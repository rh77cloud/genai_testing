businesses from October 1 through December 31, 2023 by quadrupling the originations for this period, and apply the
annualized number of originations to both calendar years 2022 and 2023.
ii. A financial institution may comply with § 1002.114(c)(2) by assuming that every covered credit transaction it
originates for business customers in calendar years 2022 and 2023 is to a small business.
iii. A financial institution may comply with § 1002.114(c)(2) by using another methodology provided that such
methodology is reasonable and documented in writing.
6. Examples. The following scenarios illustrate the potential application of § 1002.114(c)(2) to a financial institution's
compliance date under § 1002.114(b).
i. Prior to October 1, 2023, Financial Institution A did not collect gross annual revenue or other information that would
allow it to determine the small business status of the businesses for whom it originated covered credit transactions in
calendar years 2022 and 2023. Financial Institution A chose to use the methodology set out in comment 114(c)-5.i and
as of October 1, 2023 began to collect information on gross annual revenue as defined in § 1002.107(a)(14) for its
covered credit transactions originated for businesses. Using this information, Financial Institution A determined that it
had originated 750 covered credit transactions for businesses that were small as defined in § 1002.106. On an
annualized basis, Financial Institution A originated 3,000 covered credit transactions for small businesses (750
originations * 4 = 3,000 originations per year). Applying this annualized figure of 3,000 originations to both calendar
years 2022 and 2023, Financial Institution A is in Tier 1 and has a compliance date of October 1, 2024.

Prior to April 1, 2023, Financial Institution C did not collect gross annual revenue or other information that would allow
it to determine the small business status of the businesses for whom it originated covered credit transactions in
calendar years 2022 and 2023. Financial Institution C chose its own methodology pursuant to comment 114(c)-5.iii,
basing it in part on the methodology specified in comment 114(c)-5.i. Starting on April 1, 2023, Financial Institution C
began to ask all business applicants for covered credit transactions if they had gross annual revenue in their preceding
fiscal year of $5 million or less. Using this information, Financial Institution C determined that it had originated 100
covered credit transactions for businesses that were small as defined in § 1002.106. On an annualized basis, Financial
Institution C originated approximately 133 covered credit transactions for small businesses ((100 originations * 365
days)/275 days = 132.73 originations per year). Applying this estimate of 133 originations to both calendar years 2022
and 2023, Financial Institution C is in Tier 3 and has a compliance date of January 1, 2026.
iv. Financial Institution D did not collect gross annual revenue or other information that would allow it to determine the
small business status of the businesses for whom it originated covered credit transactions in calendar years 2022 and
2023. Financial Institution D determined that it had originated 3,000 total covered credit transactions for businesses in
each of 2022 and 2023. Applying the methodology specified in comment 114(c)-5.ii, Financial Institution D assumed
that all 3,000 covered credit transactions originated in each of 2022 and 2023 were to small businesses. On that basis,
Financial Institution D is in Tier 1 and has a compliance date of October 1, 2024.
v. Financial Institution E did not collect gross annual revenue or other information that would allow it to determine the
small business status of the businesses for whom it originated covered credit transactions in calendar years 2022 and
2023. Financial Institution E determined that it had originated 700 total covered credit transactions for businesses in
each of 2022 and 2023.",1,True,,"How can a financial institution annualize the number of covered credit transactions it originates to small businesses from October 1 through December 31, 2023?","To annualize the number of covered credit transactions a financial institution originates to small businesses from October 1 through December 31, 2023, the institution should calculate the total number of transactions during this period and then extrapolate this figure to represent a full year. This can be done by taking the total number of transactions during the specified period and multiplying it by the appropriate factor to estimate the annual volume.","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","Additionally, consideration should be limited
to factors which examiners determine to be legitimate.
While the period for review should be 12-months, prohibited
basis group and control group borrowers should be grouped
and reviewed around a range of dates during which the
institution’s practices for the term or condition being
reviewed were the same. Generally, examiners should use
the loan origination date or the loan application date.
Identify data to be analyzed for each focal point to be
reviewed and record this information for each borrower on
a spreadsheet to ensure a valid comparison regarding terms
and conditions. For example, in certain cases, an institution
may offer slightly differentiated products with significant
pricing implications to borrowers.

information regarding an affiliate or holding company

d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies

with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.

b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).

Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
",What specific information about a financial institution's parent entity must be included in the submission?,Information regarding an affiliate or holding company subsidiary should be obtained directly from the institution itself.,"Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.1
Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.

In the example
above, if the funds were also used to purchase equipment, the financial institution would select only three of the relevant
purposes to report.
3.
“Other” credit purpose. If a purpose of an application does not appear on the list of purposes provided, the financial
institution reports “other” as the credit purpose and reports the credit purpose via free-form text field. If the application has
more than one “other” purpose, the financial institution chooses the most significant “other” purpose, in its discretion, and
reports that “other” purpose. The financial institution reports a maximum of three credit purposes, including any “other”
purpose.
4. Credit purpose not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined. Pursuant to § 1002.107(c), a financial institution shall
maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which includes credit purpose. However, if a
financial institution is nonetheless unable to collect or determine credit purpose information, the financial institution reports
that the credit purpose is “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.”
5. Not applicable. If the application is for a credit product that generally has indeterminate or numerous potential purposes,
such as a credit card, the financial institution may report credit purpose as “not applicable.”
6. Collecting credit purpose. Pursuant to § 1002.107(c), a financial institution shall maintain procedures reasonably designed
to collect applicant-provided data, including credit purpose. The financial institution is permitted, but not required, to present
the list of credit purposes provided in comment 107(a)(6)-1 to the applicant. The financial institution is also permitted to
ask about purposes not included on the list provided in comment 107(a)(6)-1. If the applicant chooses a purpose or
purposes not included on the provided list, the financial institution follows the instructions in comment 107(a)(6)-3
regarding reporting of “other” as the credit purpose. If an applicant chooses a purpose or purposes that are similar to
purposes on the list provided, but uses different language, the financial institution reports the purpose or purposes from the
list provided.

for any activity, including storage.
8. Overdraft. When overdraft is provided as an aspect of the covered credit transaction applied for or originated, the financial
institution reports “Overdraft” as a purpose of the credit. The financial institution reports credit type pursuant to §
1002.107(a)(5)(i) as appropriate for the underlying covered credit transaction, such as “Line of credit—unsecured.”
Providing occasional overdraft services as part of a deposit account offering would not be reported for the purpose of

1. Initial amount requested. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(7) by reporting the initial amount of credit or
the initial credit limit requested by the applicant. The financial institution is not required to report credit amounts or limits
discussed before an application is made, but must capture the initial amount requested at the application stage. If the
applicant requests an amount as a range of numbers, the financial institution reports the midpoint of that range.
2. No amount requested. If the applicant does not request a specific amount at the application stage, but the financial
institution underwrites the application for a specific amount, the financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(7) by
reporting the amount considered for underwriting as the amount applied for.",1,True,,What does a financial institution report as the credit purpose if the applicant does not provide any information regarding the purpose of the credit?,"The financial institution typically reports the credit purpose as ""not available"" if the applicant does not provide any information regarding the purpose of the credit.","This will help

• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting

standards should not be compared to applications

examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction

ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.

",incorrect,"The answer provided in the reference text states that if the applicant does not provide any information regarding the purpose of the credit, the financial institution reports the credit purpose as 'not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined', not as 'not available'.

This assistance is optional and not required, but it can help the applicant in making their own determinations regarding their LGBTQI+-owned business status.","If a business does not satisfy
this second prong of the definition, it is not an LGBTQI+-owned business, regardless of whether it
satisfies the first prong of the definition.
2. Purpose of definition. The definition of LGBTQI+-owned business is used only when an applicant
determines if it is an LGBTQI+-owned business for purposes of § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial
institution shall provide an applicant with the definition of LGBTQI+-owned business when asking the
applicant to provide its LGBTQI+-owned business status pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial
institution satisfies this requirement if it provides the definition as set forth in the sample data
collection form in appendix E. The financial institution must provide additional clarification by
referencing the definition of LGBTQI+ individual as set forth in § 1002.102(k) if asked by the applicant.
The financial institution is neither permitted nor required to make its own determination regarding the
applicant's LGBTQI+-owned business status.
3. Further clarifications of terms used in the definition of LGBTQI+-owned business. In order to assist an
applicant when determining whether it is an LGBTQI+-owned business, a financial institution may
provide the applicant with the definitions of ownership, control, and accrual of net profits or losses and
related concepts set forth in comments 102(l)-4 through -6. A financial institution may assist an
applicant when the applicant is determining its LGBTQI+-owned business status but is not required to
do so. For purposes of reporting an applicant's status, a financial institution relies on the applicant's
determinations of its ownership, control, and accrual of net profits and losses.
4. Ownership. For purposes of determining if a business is an LGBTQI+-owned business, an individual
owns a business if that individual directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement,
understanding, relationship or otherwise, has an equity interest in the business. Examples of ownership
include being the sole proprietor of a sole proprietorship, directly or indirectly owning or holding the
stock of a corporation or company, directly or indirectly having a partnership interest in a business, or
directly or indirectly having a membership interest in a limited liability company.

General. In no way are the limitations to the term applicant in § 1002.102(b) of subpart B intended to
repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, change, or interfere with the scope of the term applicant in § 1002.2(e)
as applicable to subpart A.
1. General. In order to be an LGBTQI+-owned business for purposes of subpart B of this part, a business
must satisfy both prongs of the definition of LGBTQI+-owned business. First, one or more LGBTQI+
individuals must own or control more than 50 percent of the business. However, it is not necessary that
one or more LGBTQI+ individuals both own and control more than 50 percent of the business. For
example, a business that is owned entirely by one or more LGBTQI+ individuals but is not controlled by
any one or more such individuals satisfies the first prong of the definition. Similarly, a business that is
controlled by an LGBTQI+ individual satisfies this first prong of the definition, even if none of the
individuals with ownership in the business are LGBTQI+ individuals. If a business does not satisfy this
first prong of the definition, it is not an LGBTQI+-owned business. Second, 50 percent or more of the
net profits or losses must accrue to one or more LGBTQI+ individuals. If a business does not satisfy
this second prong of the definition, it is not an LGBTQI+-owned business, regardless of whether it
satisfies the first prong of the definition.
2. Purpose of definition. The definition of LGBTQI+-owned business is used only when an applicant
determines if it is an LGBTQI+-owned business for purposes of § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial
institution shall provide an applicant with the definition of LGBTQI+-owned business when asking the
applicant to provide its LGBTQI+-owned business status pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial
institution satisfies this requirement if it provides the definition as set forth in the sample data
collection form in appendix E. The financial institution must provide additional clarification by
referencing the definition of LGBTQI+ individual as set forth in § 1002.102(k) if asked by the applicant.",1,True,,How can a financial institution assist an applicant in determining if their business qualifies as an LGBTQI+-owned business?,"The financial institution can assist an applicant in determining if their business qualifies as an LGBTQI+-owned business by providing clear guidelines or criteria for what constitutes an LGBTQI+ owned business. This can include asking the applicant to self-identify as LGBTQI+ owned, providing documentation or certification if available, or seeking information on the ownership structure and control of the business to verify LGBTQI+ ownership status. Additionally, the institution can offer support and guidance to applicants who may be unsure about their eligibility as an LGBTQI+ owned business.","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

Step Five: Organize and Focus Residential Risk Analysis
Review the risk factors identified in Step 4 and, for each loan
product that displays risk factors, articulate the possible
discriminatory effects encountered and organize the
examination of those loan products in accordance with the
following guidance. For complex issues regarding these
factors, consult with agency supervisory staff.
• Where overt evidence of discrimination, as described in
factors O1-O5, has been found in connection with a
product, document those findings as described in Part III,
B, besides completing the remainder of the planned
examination analysis.
• Where any of the risk factors U1-U9 are present,
consider conducting an underwriting comparative file
analysis as described in Part III, C.
• Where any of the risk factors P1-P7 are present,
consider conducting a pricing comparative file analysis
as described in Part III, D.
• Where any of the risk factors S1-S8 are present,
consider conducting a steering analysis as described in
Part III, E.
• Where any of the risk factors R1-R12 are present,
consider conducting an analysis for redlining as described
in Part III, G.
• Where any of the risk factors M1-M7 are present,
consider conducting a marketing analysis as described in
Part III, H.
• Where an institution uses age in any credit scoring system,
consider conducting an examination analysis of that credit
scoring system’s compliance with the requirements of
Regulation B as described in Part III, I.
Step Six: Identify Consumer Lending Discrimination Risk
Factors
For any consumer loan products selected in Step One for risk
analysis, examiners should conduct a risk factor review similar
to that conducted for residential lending products in Steps
Three through Five, above. Examiners should consult with
agency supervisory staff regarding the potential use of
surrogates to identify possible prohibited basis group
individuals.
",How can a financial institution assist an applicant in determining if their business qualifies as an LGBTQI+-owned business?,"The financial institution can assist an applicant in determining if their business qualifies as an LGBTQI+-owned business by providing clear guidelines or criteria for what constitutes an LGBTQI+ owned business.

businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.

guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in

• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
",Explain the significance of the credit score and how it is used in making credit decisions according to the document.,"Credit scoring is utilized by institutions as a tool to evaluate creditworthiness and make informed decisions regarding loan products. It plays a crucial role in the underwriting process by assessing various factors, including age, to determine the risk associated with extending credit. The credit scoring program may be the primary determinant for underwriting decisions or serve as a guide in the decision-making process. By scoring different aspects of a loan applicant's profile, institutions can streamline the evaluation process and ensure consistency in assessing credit applications. This systematic approach helps in efficiently managing risk and making objective lending decisions based on predetermined criteria.","I. Credit Scoring.

standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
",Explain the significance of the credit score and how it is used in making credit decisions according to the document.,"Credit scoring is utilized by institutions as a tool to evaluate loan applicants based on their creditworthiness. It plays a crucial role in the underwriting process by providing a systematic way to assess the risk associated with lending to an individual. The credit score may serve as the primary factor in determining loan approval or as a guiding element in the decision-making process. Institutions may have specific credit scoring programs that assign scores based on various factors such as age, financial history, and other relevant data points. These scores help in streamlining the underwriting process and enable institutions to make consistent and objective loan decisions. Additionally, credit scoring can assist in identifying potential risks associated with lending to certain individuals, thereby aiding in maintaining fair lending practices.","I. Credit Scoring.
If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

",incorrect,"The question asks for the contact information for regulatory bodies based on the total assets of banks, savings associations, and credit unions. The reference text provides contact information for various regulatory bodies based on different criteria, including total assets over $10 billion. The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) is mentioned in the reference text for Nonmember Insured Banks, Insured State Branches of Foreign Banks, and Insured State Savings Associations. However, the specific mention of total assets is missing in the answer. Therefore, the answer is only partially correct as it does not directly address the total assets criteria specified in the question.",Incorrect
9,9,10,reg b,db86e4b8a43a1304,How should a financial institution report a credit product that is not provided by the applicant and otherwise undetermined?,"The financial institution should report that the credit product is ""not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.""","4. Credit product not provided by the applicant and otherwise undetermined. Pursuant to § 1002.107(c), a financial institution is
required to maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which includes credit product.
However, if a financial institution is nonetheless unable to collect or otherwise determine credit product information
because the applicant does not indicate what credit product it seeks and the application is denied, withdrawn, or closed for
incompleteness before a credit product is identified, the financial institution reports that the credit product is “not provided
by applicant and otherwise undetermined.”
5. Reporting credit product involving counteroffers. If a financial institution presents a counteroffer for a different credit
product than the product the applicant had initially requested, and the applicant does not agree to proceed with the
counteroffer, the financial institution reports the application for the original credit product as denied pursuant to §
1002.107(a)(9). If the applicant agrees to proceed with consideration of the financial institution's counteroffer, the financial
institution reports the disposition of the application based on the credit product that was offered and does not report the
original credit product applied for. See comment 107(a)(9)-2.
6. Other sales-based financing transaction. For an extension of business credit incident to a factoring arrangement that is
otherwise a covered credit transaction, a financial institution selects “other sales-based financing transaction” as the credit
product. See comment 104(b)-1.
7. Guarantees. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(5)(ii) by selecting the type or types of guarantees that were
obtained for an originated covered credit transaction, or that would have been obtained if the covered credit transaction
was originated, from the list below. The financial institution selects, if applicable, up to a maximum of five guarantees for a
single application. If the type of guarantee does not appear on the list, the financial institution selects “other” and reports
the type of guarantee via free-form text field.

If a credit product, such as a credit
card, does not have a loan term, the financial institution reports that the loan term is “not applicable.” The financial
institution also reports that the loan term is “not applicable” if the credit product is reported as “not provided by applicant
and otherwise undetermined.” For a credit product that generally has a loan term, the financial institution reports “not
provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined” if the application is denied, withdrawn, or determined to be incomplete
before a loan term has been identified. For merchant cash advances and other sales-based financing transactions, the
financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(5)(iii) by reporting the loan term, if any, that the financial institution
estimated or specified in processing, underwriting or providing disclosures for the application or transaction. If more than
one such loan term is estimated or specified, the financial institution reports the one it considers to be most accurate, in its
discretion. For merchant cash advances and other sales-based financing transactions that do not have a loan term, the
financial institution reports “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.”
1. General. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(6) by selecting the purpose or purposes of the covered credit
transaction applied for or originated from the list below.
i. Purchase, construction/improvement, or refinance of non-owner-occupied real property.
ii. Purchase, construction/improvement, or refinance of owner-occupied real property.
iii. Purchase, refinance, or rehabilitation/repair of motor vehicle(s) (including light and heavy trucks).
iv. Purchase, refinance, or rehabilitation/repair of equipment.

xiii.",1,True,,How should a financial institution report a credit product that is not provided by the applicant and otherwise undetermined?,"The financial institution should document any credit product that is not provided by the applicant and remains undetermined. This documentation should include details on the product, the reason it was not provided by the applicant, and any relevant information regarding the decision-making process around this undetermined credit product. This documentation is important for transparency and compliance purposes within the institution's reporting and record-keeping procedures.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any

control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","Clarify what options are available to applicants

documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","Clarify what options are available to applicants
Through interviews with appropriate personnel of the
institution and review of policy manuals, procedure
guidelines and other directives, obtain and verify the
following information for each product-alternative product
pairing or grouping identified above:
a. All underwriting criteria for the product or feature and
their alternatives that are offered by the institution or by
a subsidiary or affiliate. Examples of products may
include stated income, negative amortization, and
options ARMs. ",How should a financial institution report a credit product that is not provided by the applicant and otherwise undetermined?,"The financial institution should document any policies and procedures established for referring an applicant who does not meet the institution's criteria to another internal lending channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Additionally, they should document any policies for offering alternatives to an applicant who does not meet the criteria for a specific product or feature. If the applicant applies through one internal lending channel for a product but appears qualified for a loan through another channel, the institution should also document the referral process in such cases.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek

information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.

This means that if the business defaults on the loan, the owner(s) are personally liable to repay the debt. On the other hand, a personal guarantee by non-owner(s) would involve individuals who are not owners of the business agreeing to take on personal liability for the loan. In this case, individuals who are not directly involved in the ownership of the business are providing a personal guarantee to ensure repayment of the credit.","(See § 1002.6(c) on consideration of state property laws.)
3. Renewals. If the borrower's creditworthiness is reevaluated when a credit obligation is renewed, the creditor must
determine whether an additional party is still warranted and, if not warranted, release the additional party.
1. Guarantees. A guarantee on an extension of credit is part of a credit transaction and therefore subject to the
regulation. A creditor may require the personal guarantee of the partners, directors, or officers of a business, and
the shareholders of a closely held corporation, even if the business or corporation is creditworthy. The
requirement must be based on the guarantor's relationship with the business or corporation, however, and not on
a prohibited basis. For example, a creditor may not require guarantees only for women-owned or minority-owned
businesses. Similarly, a creditor may not require guarantees only of the married officers of a business or the
married shareholders of a closely held corporation.
2. Spousal guarantees. The rules in § 1002.7(d) bar a creditor from requiring the signature of a guarantor's spouse
just as they bar the creditor from requiring the signature of an applicant's spouse. For example, although a
creditor may require all officers of a closely held corporation to personally guarantee a corporate loan, the
creditor may not automatically require that spouses of married officers also sign the guarantee. If an evaluation
of the financial circumstances of an officer indicates that an additional signature is necessary, however, the
creditor may require the signature of another person in appropriate circumstances in accordance with §
1002.7(d)(2).
1. Differences in terms. Differences in the availability, rates, and other terms on which credit-related casualty
insurance or credit life, health, accident, or disability insurance is offered or provided to an applicant does not
violate Regulation B.
2. Insurance information. A creditor may obtain information about an applicant's age, sex, or marital status for
insurance purposes. The information may only be used for determining eligibility and premium rates for
insurance, however, and not in making the credit decision.

8. Loan term. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(5)(iii) by reporting the number of months in the loan term for
the covered credit transaction. The loan term is the number of months after which the legal obligation will mature or
terminate, measured from the date of origination. For transactions involving real property, the financial institution may
instead measure the loan term from the date of the first payment period and disregard the time that elapses, if any, between
the settlement of the transaction and the first payment period. For example, if a loan closes on April 12, but the first
payment is not due until June 1 and includes the interest accrued in May (but not April), the financial institution may choose
not to include the month of April in the loan term. In addition, the financial institution may round the loan term to the nearest
full month or may count only full months and ignore partial months, as it so chooses. If a credit product, such as a credit
card, does not have a loan term, the financial institution reports that the loan term is “not applicable.” The financial
institution also reports that the loan term is “not applicable” if the credit product is reported as “not provided by applicant
and otherwise undetermined.” For a credit product that generally has a loan term, the financial institution reports “not
provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined” if the application is denied, withdrawn, or determined to be incomplete
before a loan term has been identified. For merchant cash advances and other sales-based financing transactions, the
financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(5)(iii) by reporting the loan term, if any, that the financial institution
estimated or specified in processing, underwriting or providing disclosures for the application or transaction.",1,True,,Explain the difference between a personal guarantee by owner(s) and a personal guarantee by non-owner(s) in the context of loan guarantees.,"A personal guarantee by owner(s) typically involves the owner(s) of a business taking personal responsibility for a loan, using their personal assets as collateral in case the business defaults on the loan. On the other hand, a personal guarantee by non-owner(s) involves individuals who are not owners of the business but are willing to personally guarantee the loan, essentially agreeing to be responsible for the debt if the business is unable to repay it.","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any

g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
",Explain the difference between a personal guarantee by owner(s) and a personal guarantee by non-owner(s) in the context of loan guarantees.,"A personal guarantee by owner(s) typically involves the owner(s) of a business agreeing to be personally liable for the repayment of a loan taken out by the business.

On the other hand, a personal guarantee by non-owner(s) involves individuals who are not owners of the business agreeing to be personally liable for the loan.

11,11,12,reg b,1c0672141ec4de16,Explain the two prongs of the definition of an LGBTQI+-owned business as outlined in subpart B of the document.,"To be considered an LGBTQI+-owned business for purposes of subpart B, a business must satisfy two prongs of the definition. Firstly, one or more LGBTQI+ individuals must own or control more than 50 percent of the business. It is not required that these individuals both own and control the business. For example, a business entirely owned by LGBTQI+ individuals but not controlled by them still satisfies the first prong. Secondly, 50 percent or more of the net profits or losses must accrue to one or more LGBTQI+ individuals. If a business does not meet this second prong, it cannot be classified as an LGBTQI+-owned business, regardless of whether it meets the first prong.","General. In no way are the limitations to the term applicant in § 1002.102(b) of subpart B intended to
repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, change, or interfere with the scope of the term applicant in § 1002.2(e)
as applicable to subpart A.
1. General. In order to be an LGBTQI+-owned business for purposes of subpart B of this part, a business
must satisfy both prongs of the definition of LGBTQI+-owned business. First, one or more LGBTQI+
individuals must own or control more than 50 percent of the business. However, it is not necessary that
one or more LGBTQI+ individuals both own and control more than 50 percent of the business. For
example, a business that is owned entirely by one or more LGBTQI+ individuals but is not controlled by
any one or more such individuals satisfies the first prong of the definition. Similarly, a business that is
controlled by an LGBTQI+ individual satisfies this first prong of the definition, even if none of the
individuals with ownership in the business are LGBTQI+ individuals. If a business does not satisfy this
first prong of the definition, it is not an LGBTQI+-owned business. Second, 50 percent or more of the
net profits or losses must accrue to one or more LGBTQI+ individuals. If a business does not satisfy
this second prong of the definition, it is not an LGBTQI+-owned business, regardless of whether it
satisfies the first prong of the definition.
2. Purpose of definition. The definition of LGBTQI+-owned business is used only when an applicant
determines if it is an LGBTQI+-owned business for purposes of § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial
institution shall provide an applicant with the definition of LGBTQI+-owned business when asking the
applicant to provide its LGBTQI+-owned business status pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial
institution satisfies this requirement if it provides the definition as set forth in the sample data
collection form in appendix E. The financial institution must provide additional clarification by
referencing the definition of LGBTQI+ individual as set forth in § 1002.102(k) if asked by the applicant.

If a business does not satisfy
this second prong of the definition, it is not an LGBTQI+-owned business, regardless of whether it
satisfies the first prong of the definition.
2. Purpose of definition. The definition of LGBTQI+-owned business is used only when an applicant
determines if it is an LGBTQI+-owned business for purposes of § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial
institution shall provide an applicant with the definition of LGBTQI+-owned business when asking the
applicant to provide its LGBTQI+-owned business status pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial
institution satisfies this requirement if it provides the definition as set forth in the sample data
collection form in appendix E. The financial institution must provide additional clarification by
referencing the definition of LGBTQI+ individual as set forth in § 1002.102(k) if asked by the applicant.
The financial institution is neither permitted nor required to make its own determination regarding the
applicant's LGBTQI+-owned business status.
3. Further clarifications of terms used in the definition of LGBTQI+-owned business. In order to assist an
applicant when determining whether it is an LGBTQI+-owned business, a financial institution may
provide the applicant with the definitions of ownership, control, and accrual of net profits or losses and
related concepts set forth in comments 102(l)-4 through -6. A financial institution may assist an
applicant when the applicant is determining its LGBTQI+-owned business status but is not required to
do so. For purposes of reporting an applicant's status, a financial institution relies on the applicant's
determinations of its ownership, control, and accrual of net profits and losses.
4. Ownership. For purposes of determining if a business is an LGBTQI+-owned business, an individual
owns a business if that individual directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement,
understanding, relationship or otherwise, has an equity interest in the business. Examples of ownership
include being the sole proprietor of a sole proprietorship, directly or indirectly owning or holding the
stock of a corporation or company, directly or indirectly having a partnership interest in a business, or
directly or indirectly having a membership interest in a limited liability company.",1,True,,Explain the two prongs of the definition of an LGBTQI+-owned business as outlined in subpart B of the document.,The two prongs of the definition of an LGBTQI+-owned business as outlined in subpart B of the document are based on the ownership and control of the business. The first prong focuses on the business being at least 51% owned by one or more LGBTQI+ individuals who are either U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. The second prong emphasizes that one or more LGBTQI+ individuals must control the management and daily operations of the business.,"U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group

U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate

characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a

as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan

A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part

Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

It mentions that the first prong requires more than 50% ownership by LGBTQI+ individuals and clarifies that ownership and control do not have to be by the same individuals. The second prong emphasizes the need for LGBTQI+ individuals to control the management and daily operations of the business. The answer aligns with the details provided in the reference text.,
12,12,13,reg b,8cbd29c1c847da99,How is the scope of appropriate corrective action determined for a creditor in relation to the self-test conducted?,"The scope of appropriate corrective action for a creditor in relation to the self-test conducted is determined on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the corrective action needed is governed by the scope of the self-test. This means that the creditor's corrective actions should align with the findings and areas identified during the self-testing process.","In
determining whether it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, a creditor must treat testers as if they are actual applicants for
credit. A creditor may not refuse to take appropriate corrective action under this section because the self-test used fictitious loan
applicants. The fact that a tester's agreement with the creditor waives the tester's legal right to assert a violation does not eliminate
the requirement for the creditor to take corrective action, although no remedial relief for the tester is required under paragraph 15(c)
(3).
15(c)(2) Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action.
1. Whether a creditor has taken or is taking corrective action that is appropriate will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Generally,
the scope of the corrective action that is needed to preserve the privilege is governed by the scope of the self-test. For example, a
creditor that self-tests mortgage loans and discovers evidence of discrimination may focus its corrective actions on mortgage loans,
and is not required to expand its testing to other types of loans.
15(c)(3) Types of relief.
Paragraph 15(c)(3)(ii).
Paragraph 15(c)(3)(iii).
2. In identifying the policies or practices that are a likely cause of the violation, a creditor might identify inadequate
or improper lending policies, failure to implement established policies, employee conduct, or other causes. The
extent and scope of a likely violation may be assessed by determining which areas of operations are likely to be
affected by those policies and practices, for example, by determining the types of loans and stages of the
application process involved and the branches or offices where the violations may have occurred.
3. Depending on the method and scope of the self-test and the results of the test, appropriate corrective action may
include one or more of the following:
i. If the self-test identifies individuals whose applications were inappropriately processed, offering to extend
credit if the application was improperly denied and compensating such persons for out-of-pocket costs and
other compensatory damages;
ii. Correcting institutional policies or procedures that may have contributed to the likely violation, and adopting
new policies as appropriate;
iii. Identifying and then training and/or disciplining the employees involved;
iv.

Accordingly, a creditor might be asked to identify the self-testing method, for
example, whether preapplication testers were used or data were compiled by surveying loan applicants.
Information about the scope of the self-test (such as the types of credit transactions examined, or the geographic
area covered by the test) also is not privileged.

1. Property appraisal reports, minutes of loan committee meetings or other documents reflecting the basis for a decision to approve
or deny an application, loan policies or procedures, underwriting standards, and broker compensation records are examples of the
types of records that are not privileged. If a creditor arranges for testers to submit loan applications for processing, the records are
not related to actual credit transactions for purposes of this paragraph and may be privileged self-testing records.
15(c) Appropriate corrective action.
1. The rule only addresses the corrective actions required for a creditor to take advantage of the privilege in this section. A creditor
may be required to take other actions or provide additional relief if a formal finding of discrimination is made.
15(c)(1) General requirement.
1. Appropriate corrective action is required even though no violation has been formally adjudicated or admitted by the creditor. In
determining whether it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, a creditor must treat testers as if they are actual applicants for
credit. A creditor may not refuse to take appropriate corrective action under this section because the self-test used fictitious loan
applicants. The fact that a tester's agreement with the creditor waives the tester's legal right to assert a violation does not eliminate

Scoping may disclose the existence of circumstances —

specialized procedures should be employed for such loan
products rather than the procedures set forth below.
Setting the intensity of an examination means determining the
breadth and depth of the analysis that will be conducted on the
selected loan product(s). This process entails a more involved
analysis of the institution’s compliance risk management
processes, particularly as it relates to selected products, to
reach an informed decision regarding how large a sample of
files to review in any transactional analyses performed and
whether certain aspects of the credit process deserve
heightened scrutiny.

interdependence between these two phases. Ultimately the

record of performance that serves as the foundation for
agency conclusions about institutional compliance with fair
lending obligations. The examiner should employ these
procedures to arrive at a well-reasoned and practical
conclusion about how to conduct a particular institution’s
examination of fair lending performance.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.5
In certain cases where an agency already possesses
information which provides examiners with guidance on
priorities and risks for planning an upcoming examination,
such information may expedite the scoping process and make
it unnecessary to carry out all of the steps below. For
example, the report of the previous fair lending examination
may have included recommendations for the focus of the next
examination. However, examiners should validate that the
institution’s operational structure, product offerings, policies,
and risks have not changed since the prior examination before
condensing the scoping process.
The scoping process can be performed either off-site, onsite, or
both, depending on whatever is determined appropriate and
feasible. In the interest of minimizing burdens on both the
examination team and the institution, requests for information
from the institution should be carefully thought out so as to
include only the information that will clearly be useful in the
examination process. Finally, any off-site information requests
should be made sufficiently in advance of the on-site schedule
to permit institutions adequate time to assemble necessary
information and provide it to the examination team in a timely
fashion. (See “Potential Scoping Information” in the
Appendix for guidance on additional information that the
examiner might wish to consider including in a request).
Examiners should focus the examination based on:
• An understanding of the credit operations
of the institution;
• The risk that discriminatory conduct may
occur in each area of those operations; and
• The feasibility of developing a factually
reliable record of an institution’s
performance and fair lending compliance in
each area of those operations.
Understanding Credit Operations
Before evaluating the potential for discriminatory conduct,
the examiner should review sufficient information about the
institution and its market to understand the credit operations
of the institution and the representation of prohibited basis
group residents within the markets where the institution does
business. The level of detail to be obtained at this stage
should be sufficient to identify whether any of the risk
factors in the steps below are present. Relevant background
information includes:
• The types and terms of credit products offered,
differentiating among broad categories of credit such as
residential, consumer, or commercial, as well as product
variations within such categories (fixed vs. variable, etc.).
• Whether the institution has a special purpose credit
program, or other program that is specifically designed to
assist certain underserved populations.
• The volume of, or growth in, lending for each of the
credit products offered.
• The demographics (i.e., race, national origin, etc.) of
the credit markets in which the institution is doing
business.
• The institution’s organization of its credit decisionmaking process, including identification of the
delegation of separate lending authorities and the extent
to which discretion in pricing or setting credit terms and
conditions is delegated to various levels of managers,
employees or independent brokers or dealers.
• The institution’s loan officer or broker
compensation program.
• The types of relevant documentation/data that are
available for various loan products and what is the
relative quantity, quality and accessibility of such
information (i.e., for which loan product(s) will the
information available be most likely to support a sound
and reliable fair lending analysis).
• The extent to which information requests can be
readily organized and coordinated with other
compliance examination components to reduce undue
burden on the institution. (Do not request more
information than the exam team can be expected to
utilize during the anticipated course of the
examination.)
In thinking about an institution’s credit markets, the
examiner should recognize that these markets may or may
not coincide with an institution’s Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA) assessment area(s). Where appropriate, the
examiner should review the demographics for a broader
geographic area than the assessment area.
Where an institution has multiple underwriting or loan
processing centers or subsidiaries, each with fully
independent credit-granting authority, consider evaluating
each center and/or subsidiary separately, provided a
sufficient number of loans exist to support a meaningful
analysis. In determining the scope of the examination for
such institutions, examiners should consider whether:
• Subsidiaries should be examined. The agencies will hold
a financial institution responsible for violations by its
direct subsidiaries, but not typically for those by its
affiliates (unless the affiliate has acted as the agent for the
institution or the violation by the affiliate was known or
should have been known to the institution before it
became involved in the transaction or purchased the
affiliate’s loans). When seeking to determine an
institution’s relationship with affiliates that are not
supervised financial institutions, limit the inquiry to what
can be learned in the institution and do not contact the

relative quantity, quality and accessibility of such
information (i.e., for which loan product(s) will the
information available be most likely to support a sound
and reliable fair lending analysis).
• The extent to which information requests can be
readily organized and coordinated with other
compliance examination components to reduce undue
burden on the institution. (Do not request more
information than the exam team can be expected to
utilize during the anticipated course of the
examination.)
In thinking about an institution’s credit markets, the
examiner should recognize that these markets may or may
not coincide with an institution’s Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA) assessment area(s). Where appropriate, the
examiner should review the demographics for a broader
geographic area than the assessment area.
Where an institution has multiple underwriting or loan
processing centers or subsidiaries, each with fully
independent credit-granting authority, consider evaluating
each center and/or subsidiary separately, provided a
sufficient number of loans exist to support a meaningful
analysis. In determining the scope of the examination for
such institutions, examiners should consider whether:
• Subsidiaries should be examined. The agencies will hold
a financial institution responsible for violations by its
direct subsidiaries, but not typically for those by its
affiliates (unless the affiliate has acted as the agent for the
institution or the violation by the affiliate was known or
should have been known to the institution before it
became involved in the transaction or purchased the
affiliate’s loans). When seeking to determine an
institution’s relationship with affiliates that are not
supervised financial institutions, limit the inquiry to what
can be learned in the institution and do not contact the

• The underwriting standards and procedures used in the
entity being reviewed are used in related entities not
scheduled for the planned examination. ",How is the scope of appropriate corrective action determined for a creditor in relation to the self-test conducted?,"The scope of appropriate corrective action for a creditor in relation to the self-test conducted is determined by identifying any compliance program or system deficiencies that merit correction or improvement and presenting these to management in accordance with the procedures outlined. Additionally, if the self-test or self-evaluation meets the requirements set forth in the guidance provided, examiners may streamline the examination process, consistent with agency guidance.","• Identify any compliance program or system deficiencies
that merit correction or improvement and present these to
management in accordance with Part IV of these
procedures.
Where an institution performs a self-evaluation or has
voluntarily disclosed the report or results of a self-test of
any product or issue that is within the scope of the
examination and has been selected for analysis pursuant to
Part I of these procedures, examiners may streamline the
examination, consistent with agency guidance, provided
the self-test or self-evaluation meets the requirements set
forth in Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations to
Streamline the Examination located in the Appendix.
Part III — Examination Procedures3
Once the scope and intensity of the examination have been
determined, assess the institution’s fair lending
performance by applying the appropriate procedures that
follow to each of the examination focal points already
selected.
A. Verify Accuracy of Data
Prior to any analysis and preferably before the scoping
process, examiners should assess the accuracy of the data
being reviewed. Data verifications should follow specific
protocols (sampling, size, etc.) ","Refer to Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations
to Streamline the Examination in the Appendix for
additional details.
Scoping may disclose the existence of circumstances —
such as the use of credit scoring or a large volume of
residential lending — which, under an agency’s policy, call
for the use of regression analysis or other statistical methods
of identifying potential discrimination with respect to one or
more loan products. Where that is the case, the agency’s
specialized procedures should be employed for such loan
products rather than the procedures set forth below.
Setting the intensity of an examination means determining the
breadth and depth of the analysis that will be conducted on the
selected loan product(s). This process entails a more involved
analysis of the institution’s compliance risk management
processes, particularly as it relates to selected products, to
reach an informed decision regarding how large a sample of
files to review in any transactional analyses performed and
whether certain aspects of the credit process deserve
heightened scrutiny.
Part I of these procedures provides guidance on establishing
the scope of the examination. Part II (Compliance
Management Review) provides guidance on determining the
intensity of the examination. There is naturally some
interdependence between these two phases. Ultimately the
scope and intensity of the examination will determine the
record of performance that serves as the foundation for
agency conclusions about institutional compliance with fair
lending obligations. The examiner should employ these
procedures to arrive at a well-reasoned and practical
conclusion about how to conduct a particular institution’s
examination of fair lending performance.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.5
In certain cases where an agency already possesses
information which provides examiners with guidance on
priorities and risks for planning an upcoming examination,
such information may expedite the scoping process and make
it unnecessary to carry out all of the steps below. For
example, the report of the previous fair lending examination
may have included recommendations for the focus of the next
examination. However, examiners should validate that the
institution’s operational structure, product offerings, policies,
and risks have not changed since the prior examination before
condensing the scoping process.
The scoping process can be performed either off-site, onsite, or
both, depending on whatever is determined appropriate and
feasible. In the interest of minimizing burdens on both the
examination team and the institution, requests for information
from the institution should be carefully thought out so as to
include only the information that will clearly be useful in the
examination process. Finally, any off-site information requests
should be made sufficiently in advance of the on-site schedule
to permit institutions adequate time to assemble necessary
information and provide it to the examination team in a timely
fashion. (See “Potential Scoping Information” in the
Appendix for guidance on additional information that the
examiner might wish to consider including in a request).
Examiners should focus the examination based on:
• An understanding of the credit operations
of the institution;
• The risk that discriminatory conduct may
occur in each area of those operations; and
• The feasibility of developing a factually
reliable record of an institution’s
performance and fair lending compliance in
each area of those operations.
Understanding Credit Operations
Before evaluating the potential for discriminatory conduct,
the examiner should review sufficient information about the
institution and its market to understand the credit operations
of the institution and the representation of prohibited basis
group residents within the markets where the institution does
business. The level of detail to be obtained at this stage
should be sufficient to identify whether any of the risk
factors in the steps below are present. Relevant background
information includes:
• The types and terms of credit products offered,
differentiating among broad categories of credit such as
residential, consumer, or commercial, as well as product
variations within such categories (fixed vs. variable, etc.).
• Whether the institution has a special purpose credit
program, or other program that is specifically designed to
assist certain underserved populations.
• The volume of, or growth in, lending for each of the
credit products offered.
• The demographics (i.e., race, national origin, etc.) of
the credit markets in which the institution is doing
business.
• The institution’s organization of its credit decisionmaking process, including identification of the
delegation of separate lending authorities and the extent
to which discretion in pricing or setting credit terms and
conditions is delegated to various levels of managers,
employees or independent brokers or dealers.
• The institution’s loan officer or broker
compensation program.
• The types of relevant documentation/data that are
available for various loan products and what is the
relative quantity, quality and accessibility of such
information (i.e., for which loan product(s) will the
information available be most likely to support a sound
and reliable fair lending analysis).
• The extent to which information requests can be
readily organized and coordinated with other
compliance examination components to reduce undue
burden on the institution. (Do not request more
information than the exam team can be expected to
utilize during the anticipated course of the
examination.)

(1) Applications. A state may apply to the Bureau for an exemption from the requirements of the Act and this part for any
class of credit transactions within the state. The Bureau will grant such an exemption if the Bureau determines that:
(i) The class of credit transactions is subject to state law requirements substantially similar to those of the Act and
this part or that applicants are afforded greater protection under state law; and
(ii) There is adequate provision for state enforcement.
(2) Liability and enforcement.
(i) No exemption will extend to the civil liability provisions of section 706 of the Act or the administrative
enforcement provisions of section 704 of the Act.
(ii) After an exemption has been granted, the requirements of the applicable state law (except for additional
requirements not imposed by Federal law) will constitute the requirements of the Act and this part.
(a) Retention of prohibited information. A creditor may retain in its files information that is prohibited by the Act or this part for
use in evaluating applications, without violating the Act or this part, if the information was obtained:
(1) From any source prior to March 23, 1977;
(2) From consumer reporting agencies, an applicant, or others without the specific request of the creditor; or
(3) As required to monitor compliance with the Act and this part or other Federal or state statutes or regulations.
(b) Preservation of records —
(1) Applications. For 25 months (12 months for business credit, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section or
otherwise provided for in subpart B of this part) after the date that a creditor notifies an applicant of action taken on an
application or of incompleteness, the creditor shall retain in original form or a copy thereof:
(i) Any application that it receives, any information required to be obtained concerning characteristics of the
applicant to monitor compliance with the Act and this part or other similar law, any information obtained pursuant
to § 1002.5(a)(4), and any other written or recorded information used in evaluating the application and not
returned to the applicant at the applicant's request.

This paragraph
does not limit any other penalty or remedy that may be available for a violation of § 1002.12.
(3) Limited use of privileged information. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the self-test report or results
and any other information privileged under this section may be obtained and used by an applicant or government
agency solely to determine a penalty or remedy after a violation of the Act or this part has been adjudicated or
admitted. Disclosures for this limited purpose may be used only for the particular proceeding in which the adjudication

A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the

neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.

considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
",Under what circumstances can a creditor retain prohibited information in its files without violating the Act or this part?,"A creditor can retain prohibited information in its files without violating the Act or this part if the information is kept for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason such as for regulatory compliance, record-keeping requirements, or risk management purposes. It is important that the retention of such information does not influence the credit decision-making process or lead to discriminatory practices against applicants.","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.

expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.

information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or

The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate

and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these

",correct,The answer correctly states that a creditor can retain prohibited information in its files if it is kept for a legitimate business purpose that is not related to a prohibited basis for discrimination. This aligns with the reference text which allows retention of prohibited information for specific purposes such as evaluating applications or monitoring compliance with laws. The answer captures the essence of the conditions under which prohibited information can be retained without violating the Act or regulations.,
14,14,15,reg b,a6da9eb8ff5c296e,How does a financial institution handle applicant-provided data according to the regulations outlined in the document?,"A financial institution handles applicant-provided data by collecting it without a direct request to the applicant in certain circumstances, updating the data if more current information is obtained during the application process, and reporting the most accurate information believed to be true. The institution must have procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, seeking to maximize collection and minimize missing or erroneous data. The initial request for applicant-provided data should not occur simultaneous with or after notifying an applicant of final action taken on a covered application.","Applicant-provided data
do not include data that are generated or supplied only by the financial institution, including § 1002.107(a)(1) (unique
identifier), § 1002.107(a)(2) (application date), § 1002.107(a)(3) (application method), § 1002.107(a)(4) (application
recipient), § 1002.107(a)(8) (amount approved or originated), § 1002.107(a)(9) (action taken), § 1002.107(a)(10) (action
taken date), § 1002.107(a)(11) (denial reasons), § 1002.107(a)(12) (pricing information), and § 1002.107(a)(13) (census
tract, based on address or location provided by the applicant).
4. Collecting applicant-provided data without a direct request to the applicant. Depending on the circumstances and the
financial institution's procedures, certain applicant-provided data can be collected without a direct request to the applicant.
For example, credit type may be collected based on the type of product chosen by the applicant. Similarly, a financial
institution may rely on appropriate third-party sources to collect certain applicant-provided data. See § 1002.107(b)
concerning the use of third-party sources.
5. Data updated by the applicant. A financial institution reports updated data if it obtains more current data from the applicant
during the application process. For example, if an applicant states its gross annual revenue for the preceding fiscal year
was $3 million, but then the applicant notifies the financial institution that its revenue in the preceding fiscal year was
actually $3.2 million, the financial institution reports gross annual revenue of $3.2 million. For reporting verified applicant-
provided data, see § 1002.107(b) and comment 107(b)-1. If a financial institution has already verified data and then the
applicant updates it, the financial institution reports the information it believes to be more accurate, in its discretion. If a
financial institution receives updates from the applicant after the application process has closed (for example, after closing
or account opening), the financial institution may, at its discretion, update the data at any time prior to reporting the covered
application to the Bureau.

1. In general. Whether a financial institution's procedures are reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data is a fact-
based determination and may depend on the financial institution's particular lending model, product offerings, and other
circumstances; procedures that are reasonably designed to obtain a response may therefore require additional provisions
beyond the minimum criteria set forth in § 1002.107(c)(2). In general, reasonably designed procedures will seek to
maximize collection of applicant-provided data and minimize missing or erroneous data. While the requirements of §
1002.107(c)(2) do not apply to applicant-provided data that a financial institution obtains without a direct request to the
applicant, as explained in comment 107(c)(1)-4, in such instances, a covered financial institution must still comply with §
1002.107(c)(1).
2. Specific components.
i. Timing of initial collection attempt. While a financial institution has some flexibility concerning when applicant-
provided data is are collected, under no circumstances may the initial request for applicant-provided data occur
simultaneous with or after notifying an applicant of final action taken on a covered application.",1,True,,How does a financial institution handle applicant-provided data according to the regulations outlined in the document?,"A financial institution handles applicant-provided data by ensuring that the underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards are followed. They also consider descriptions of credit scoring systems, pricing policies, risk-based pricing models, and guidance for loan terms and conditions. Additionally, the institution evaluates any compensation system related to loan production or pricing and maintains formal and informal relationships with finance companies or similar entities as part of handling applicant-provided data in accordance with regulations.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.

to contact, and whether the institution sets any
parameters on how the list of consumers is compiled.

Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

e. Telemarketers or predictive dialer programs
• Learn how the institution identifies which consumers
to contact, and whether the institution sets any
parameters on how the list of consumers is compiled.
Step 2. ",How does a financial institution handle applicant-provided data according to the regulations outlined in the document?,"A financial institution handles applicant-provided data by evaluating underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards, as well as descriptions of credit scoring systems, pricing policies, risk-based pricing models, and guidance for loan terms and conditions. Additionally, the institution considers any compensation system related to loan production or pricing, formal and informal relationships with finance companies, and how telemarketers or predictive dialer programs are used to contact consumers.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.

Step 2. ",incorrect,"The answer provided does not directly address how a financial institution handles applicant-provided data according to the regulations outlined in the document. It focuses more on underwriting guidelines, policies, standards, credit scoring systems, pricing policies, risk-based pricing models, loan terms, compensation systems, and relationships with finance companies. The reference text specifically discusses collecting applicant-provided data, updating data during the application process, and the timing of data collection attempts. The answer does not align with the specific procedures and requirements mentioned in the reference text.",
15,15,16,reg b,40d96aaf7ecda1a2,How should a financial institution handle requests for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account when determining the number of covered applications?,"If a financial institution treats a request for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account as sub-components of a single account, then the institution should report the request as a single covered application. However, if the financial institution treats each line of credit as a separate account, then each request for a line of credit should be reported as a separate covered application.","5. Requests for multiple covered credit transactions at one time. Assuming the requirements of a covered
application are met, if an applicant makes a request for two or more covered credit transactions at the
same time, the financial institution reports each request as a separate covered application. For
example, if an applicant is seeking both a term loan and a line of credit and requests them both on the
same application form, the financial institution reports the requests as two separate covered
applications, one for a term loan and another for a line of credit. See § 1002.107(d) for the
requirements for reusing data so that a financial institution need only ask once for certain data
required under § 1002.107(a). If, on the other hand, the applicant is only requesting a single covered
credit transaction, but has not decided on which particular product, the financial institution reports the
request as a single covered application. For example, if the applicant indicates interest in either a term
loan or a line of credit, but not both, the financial institution reports the request as a single covered
application. See comment 107(a)(5)-1 for instructions on reporting credit product in this situation.
6. Initial request for a single covered credit transaction that would result in the origination of multiple
covered credit transactions. Assuming the requirements of a covered application are met, if an
applicant initially makes a request for one covered credit transaction, but over the course of the
application process requests multiple covered credit transactions, each covered credit transaction
must be reported as a separate covered application. See § 1002.107(d) for the requirements for
reusing data so that a financial institution need only ask once for certain data required under §
1002.107(a).
7. Requests for multiple lines of credit at one time. Assuming the requirements of a covered application
are met, if an applicant requests multiple lines of credit on a single credit account, it is reported as one
or more covered applications based on the procedures used by the financial institution for the type of
credit account. For example, if a financial institution treats a request for multiple lines of credit at one
time as sub-components of a single account, the financial institution reports the request as a single
covered application.

See § 1002.107(d) for the requirements for
reusing data so that a financial institution need only ask once for certain data required under §
1002.107(a).
7. Requests for multiple lines of credit at one time. Assuming the requirements of a covered application
are met, if an applicant requests multiple lines of credit on a single credit account, it is reported as one
or more covered applications based on the procedures used by the financial institution for the type of
credit account. For example, if a financial institution treats a request for multiple lines of credit at one
time as sub-components of a single account, the financial institution reports the request as a single
covered application. If, on the other hand, the financial institution treats each line of credit as a
separate account, then the financial institution reports each request for a line of credit as a separate
covered application, as set forth in comment 103(a)-5.
8. Duplicate applications. If a financial institution receives two or more duplicate covered applications
(i.e., from the same applicant, for the same credit product, for the same amount, at or around the same
time), the financial institution may treat the request as a single covered application for purposes of
subpart B, so long as for purposes of determining whether to extend credit, it would also treat one or
more of the applications as a duplicate under its procedures.
9. Changes in whether there is a covered credit transaction. In certain circumstances, an applicant may
change the type of product requested during the course of the application process. Assuming other
requirements of a covered application are met, if an applicant initially requests a product that is not a
covered credit transaction, but prior to final action taken decides to seek instead a product that is a
covered credit transaction, the application is a covered application and must be reported pursuant to §
1002.109. In this circumstance, the financial institution shall endeavor to compile, maintain, and report
the data required under § 1002.107(a) in a manner that is reasonable under the circumstances.",1,True,,How should a financial institution handle requests for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account when determining the number of covered applications?,"When determining the number of covered applications for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account, a financial institution should treat each line of credit as a separate application.

Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
",How should a financial institution handle requests for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account when determining the number of covered applications?,"When determining the number of covered applications for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account, a financial institution should consider each line of credit as a separate application. This means that each line of credit requested should be treated as an individual application for the purpose of evaluating fair lending compliance and potential discriminatory conduct.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,

characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services

is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
",How should a financial institution handle requests for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account when determining the number of covered applications?,"When determining the number of covered applications for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account, a financial institution should treat each line of credit as a separate application. This means that each line of credit requested should be considered individually when assessing the total number of applications for fair lending compliance purposes.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
",correct,"The answer correctly states that when determining the number of covered applications for multiple lines of credit on a single credit account, each line of credit should be treated as a separate application. This is in line with the information provided in the reference text which specifies that if an applicant requests multiple lines of credit on a single credit account, the financial institution should report each request as a separate covered application based on their procedures.

Additionally, if the application is for other than individual unsecured credit, a creditor may inquire about the applicant's marital status, but shall use only the terms married, unmarried, and separated.","(3) Other accounts of the applicant. A creditor may request that an applicant list any account on which the applicant is
contractually liable and to provide the name and address of the person in whose name the account is held. A creditor
may also ask an applicant to list the names in which the applicant has previously received credit.
(d) Other limitations on information requests —
(1) Marital status. If an applicant applies for individual unsecured credit, a creditor shall not inquire about the applicant's
marital status unless the applicant resides in a community property state or is relying on property located in such a

(2) Disclosure about income from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance. A creditor shall not inquire whether
income stated in an application is derived from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments unless the
creditor discloses to the applicant that such income need not be revealed if the applicant does not want the creditor to
consider it in determining the applicant's creditworthiness.
(3) Childbearing, childrearing. A creditor shall not inquire about birth control practices, intentions concerning the bearing

",correct,"The answer correctly states that creditors can inquire about an applicant's marital status in situations where it is necessary for the extension of credit, such as when the applicant is applying for joint credit or when the marital status may affect the applicant's ability to repay the loan. This aligns with the regulations outlined in the reference text which specify the conditions under which a creditor can inquire about marital status.",
17,17,18,reg b,8591d5adca208388,How is control of a business determined according to the provided context information?,"Control of a business is determined by whether an individual has significant responsibility to manage or direct the business. This includes being an executive officer or senior manager, regularly performing similar functions, or collectively constituting a majority of the board of directors or partners in the case of multiple individuals.","For example, assume that the applicant is company A. If company B owns 60 percent of the
applicant company A and an individual owns 100 percent of company B, the individual owns 60 percent
of the applicant company A. Similarly, if an individual directly owns 20 percent of the applicant
company A and is an equal partner in a partnership B that owns the remaining 80 percent of the
applicant company A, the individual owns 60 percent of applicant company A (i.e., 20 percent due
through direct ownership and 40 percent indirectly through partnership B). A trustee is considered the
owner of the trust. Thus, if a trust owns a business and the trust has two co-trustees, each co-trustee
owns 50 percent of the business.
5. Control. An individual controls a business if that individual has significant responsibility to manage or
direct the business. An individual controls a business if the individual is an executive officer or senior
manager (e.g., a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, managing
member, general partner, president, vice president, or treasurer) or regularly performs similar functions.
Additionally, a business may be controlled by two or more women if those women collectively control
the business, such as constituting a majority of the board of directors or a majority of the partners of a
partnership.
6. Accrual of net profits or losses. A business's net profits and losses accrue to an individual if that
individual receives the net profits or losses, is legally entitled or required to receive the net profits or
losses, or is legally entitled or required to recognize the net profits or losses for tax purposes.
1. General. Subject to the requirements of subpart B of this part, a financial institution has latitude to
establish its own application procedures, including designating the type and amount of information it
will require from applicants.
2. Procedures used. The term “procedures” refers to the actual practices followed by a financial institution
as well as its stated application procedures.

A trustee is considered the owner of the
trust. Thus, if a trust owns a business and the trust has two co-trustees, each co-trustee owns 50
percent of the business.
5. Control. An individual controls a business if that individual has significant responsibility to manage or
direct the business. An individual controls a business if the individual is an executive officer or senior

1. General. In order to be a minority-owned business for purposes of subpart B of this part, a business
must satisfy both prongs of the definition of minority-owned business. First, one or more American
Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or
Hispanic or Latino individuals must own or control more than 50 percent of the business. However, it is
not necessary that one or more American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American,
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic or Latino individuals both own and control more
than 50 percent of the business. For example, a business that is owned entirely, but is not controlled by,
individuals belonging to one of these groups satisfies the first prong of the definition.",1,True,,How is control of a business determined according to the provided context information?,"Control of a business is determined based on the gross revenues of the business in the preceding fiscal year. Specifically, businesses with gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in the preceding fiscal year are generally considered small businesses and are the focus when implementing procedures related to commercial credit.","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
",How is control of a business determined according to the provided context information?,"Control of a business is determined based on the gross revenues of the business in the preceding fiscal year. Specifically, businesses with gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in the preceding fiscal year are generally considered small businesses and are the focus when implementing procedures related to commercial credit.","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.

i. For purposes of this timing requirement,
“provide” means “deliver.
” Delivery occurs three business days after mailing or
delivering the copies to the last-known address of the applicant, or when evidence indicates actual receipt by the
applicant, whichever is earlier. Delivery to or actual receipt by the applicant by electronic means must comply with the
E-Sign Act, as provided for in § 1002.14(a)(5).
ii. The application and meaning of the “promptly upon completion” standard depends upon the facts and circumstances,
including but not limited to when the creditor receives the appraisal or other written valuation, and the extent of any
review or revision after the creditor receives it.
iii.
“Completion” occurs when the last version is received by the creditor, or when the creditor has reviewed and accepted
the appraisal or other written valuation to include any changes or corrections required, whichever is later. See also
comment 14(a)(1)-7.
iv. In a transaction that is being consummated (for closed-end credit) or in which the account is being opened (for open-
end credit), if an appraisal or other written valuation has been developed but is not yet complete, the deadline for
providing a copy of three business days before consummation or account opening still applies, unless the applicant
waived that deadline as provided under § 1002.14(a)(1), in which case the copy must be provided at or before
consummation or account opening.
v. Even if the transaction will not be consummated (for closed-end credit) or the account will not be opened (for open-
end credit), the copy must be provided “promptly upon completion” as provided for in § 1002.14(a)(1), unless the
applicant has waived that deadline as provided under § 1002.14(a)(1), in which case as provided for in § 1002.14(a)(1)
the copy must be provided to the applicant no later than 30 days after the creditor determines the transaction will not
be consummated or the account will not be opened.

20,20,21,reg b,dccb564184c75563,What are the two prongs that a business must satisfy to be classified as a women-owned business under subpart B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act?,"The two prongs that a business must satisfy to be classified as a women-owned business under subpart B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act are: 
1. One or more women must own or control more than 50 percent of the business.
2. 50 percent or more of the net profits or losses must accrue to one or more women.","2. Trustee. Although a trust is not considered a principal owner of a business for the purposes of subpart
B, if the applicant for a covered credit transaction is a trust, a trustee is considered the owner of the
trust. Thus, if a trust is an applicant for a covered credit transaction and the trust has two co-trustees,
each co-trustee is considered to own 50 percent of the business and would each be a principal owner
as defined in § 1002.102(o). In contrast, if the trust has five co-trustees, each co-trustee is considered
to own 20 percent of the business and would not meet the definition of principal owner under §
1002.102(o).
3. Purpose of definition. A financial institution shall provide an applicant with the definition of principal
owner when asking the applicant to provide the number of its principal owners pursuant to §
1002.107(a)(20) and the ethnicity, race, and sex of its principal owners pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(19).
See comments 107(a)(19)-2 and 107(a)(20)-1.
1. General. In order to be a women-owned business for purposes of subpart B of this part, a business
must satisfy both prongs of the definition of women-owned business. First, one or more women must
own or control more than 50 percent of the business. However, it is not necessary that one or more
women both own and control more than 50 percent of the business. For example, a business that is
owned entirely by women but is not controlled by any women satisfies the first prong of the definition.

Similarly, a business that is controlled by a woman satisfies this first prong of the definition, even if
none of the individuals with ownership in the business are women. If a business does not satisfy this
first prong of the definition, it is not a women-owned business.

Similarly, a business that is controlled by a woman satisfies this first prong of the definition, even if
none of the individuals with ownership in the business are women. If a business does not satisfy this
first prong of the definition, it is not a women-owned business. Second, 50 percent or more of the net
profits or losses must accrue to one or more women. If a business does not satisfy this second prong
of the definition, it is not a women-owned business, regardless of whether it satisfies the first prong of
the definition.
2. Purpose of definition. The definition of women-owned business is used only when an applicant
determines if it is a women-owned business pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18). A financial institution shall
provide an applicant with the definition of women-owned business when asking the applicant to
provide its women-owned business status pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18), but the financial institution is
neither permitted nor required to make its own determination regarding the applicant's women-owned
business status.
3. Further clarifications of terms used in the definition of women-owned business. In order to assist an
applicant when determining whether it is a women-owned business, a financial institution may provide
the applicant with the definitions of ownership, control, and accrual of net profits or losses and related
concepts set forth in comments 102(s)-4 through -6. A financial institution may assist an applicant
when the applicant is determining its women-owned business status but is not required to do so. For
purposes of reporting an applicant's status, a financial institution relies on the applicant's
determinations of its ownership, control, and accrual of net profits and losses.

Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group

",What are the two prongs that a business must satisfy to be classified as a women-owned business under subpart B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act?,"The two prongs that a business must satisfy to be classified as a women-owned business under subpart B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act are: (1) The business must be at least 51% owned by one or more women, and (2) One or more women must control the management and daily operations of the business.","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.

 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.

21,21,22,reg b,7f05b48f1ae74985,What criteria determine if a covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for reporting purposes?,More than 50 percent of the ownership or control of the first covered financial institution being held by the second covered financial institution determines if a covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for reporting purposes.,"See appendix E for sample language.
1. Subsidiaries. A covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for purposes
of reporting data pursuant to § 1002.109 if more than 50 percent of the ownership or control of the first covered financial
institution is held by the second covered financial institution.
1. General. The following clarifies how to report applications involving more than one financial institution. The discussion
below assumes that all parties involved with the covered credit transaction are covered financial institutions. However, the
same principles apply if any party is not a covered financial institution.
i. A financial institution shall report the action that it takes on a covered application, whether or not the covered credit
transaction closed in the financial institution's name and even if the financial institution used underwriting criteria
supplied by another financial institution. However, where it is necessary for more than one financial institution to make
a credit decision in order to approve a single covered credit transaction, only the last financial institution with authority
to set the material terms of the covered credit transaction is required to report. Setting the material terms of the
covered credit transaction include, for example, selecting among competing offers, or modifying pricing information,
amount approved or originated, or repayment duration. In this situation, the determinative factor is not which financial
institution actually made the last credit decision prior to closing, but rather which financial institution last had the
authority for setting the material terms of the covered credit transaction prior to closing. Whether a financial institution
has taken action for purposes of § 1002.109(a)(3) and comment 109(a)(3)-1 is not relevant to, and is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with, section 701(d) (15 U.S.C. 1691(d)) of the Act, § 1002.9, or any other
provision within subpart A of this Regulation.
ii. A financial institution takes action on a covered application for purposes of § 1002.109(a)(3) if it denies the
application, originates the application, approves the application but the applicant did not accept the transaction, or
closes the file or denies for incompleteness. The financial institution must also report the application if it was
withdrawn.

Financial Institution A receives a covered application and approves it, and then Financial Institution A elects to
organize a loan participation agreement where Financial Institutions B and C agree to purchase a partial interest in the
covered credit transaction. Financial Institution A reports the application. Financial Institutions B and C have no
reporting obligation for this application.
x. Financial Institution A purchases an interest in a pool of covered credit transactions, such as credit-backed securities
or real estate investment conduits. Financial Institution A does not report this purchase.
3. Agents. If a covered financial institution takes action on a covered application through its agent, the financial institution
reports the application. For example, acting as Financial Institution A's agent, Financial Institution B approved an application
prior to closing and a covered credit transaction was originated. Financial Institution A reports the covered credit
transaction as an origination. State law determines whether one party is the agent of another.
1. Changes to financial institution identifying information. If a financial institution's information required pursuant to §
1002.109(b) changes, the financial institution shall provide the new information with the data submission for the collection
year of the change. For example, assume two financial institutions that previously reported data under subpart B of this part
merge and the surviving institution retained its Legal Entity Identifier but obtained a new TIN in February 2026. The surviving
institution must report the new TIN with its data submission for its 2026 data (which is due by June 1, 2027) pursuant to §
1002.109(b)(5). Likewise, if that financial institution's Federal prudential regulator changes in February 2026 as a result of
the merger, it must identify its new Federal prudential regulator in its annual submission for its 2026 data.
1. Federal prudential regulator. For purposes of § 1002.109(b)(4), Federal prudential regulator means, if applicable, the Federal
prudential regulator for a financial institution that is a depository institution as determined pursuant to section 3q of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.",1,True,,What criteria determine if a covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for reporting purposes?,"The criteria that determine if a covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for reporting purposes include obtaining any information regarding a subsidiary of the institution directly from that entity, seeking information regarding an affiliate or holding company subsidiary only from the institution itself, and understanding the formal and informal relationships with any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer lending entities, or similar institutions.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
",What criteria determine if a covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for reporting purposes?,"The criteria that determine if a covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for reporting purposes include obtaining information directly from the subsidiary entity itself, seeking information regarding an affiliate or holding company subsidiary only from the institution, and documenting all discussions with loan personnel and managers to understand the relationships and structures within the institution and its subsidiaries.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may

d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and

the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
",What criteria determine if a covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for reporting purposes?,"The criteria that determine if a covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for reporting purposes include obtaining information directly from the subsidiary entity itself, seeking information regarding an affiliate or holding company subsidiary only from the institution, and documenting all discussions with loan personnel and managers to understand the relationships and structures within the institution and its subsidiaries.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as

for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.

qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist

Step 2. ",correct,"The answer correctly explains that inconsistent state laws and preempted provisions of state law are addressed by preempting state laws that are inconsistent with the Act and Regulation B. It also provides the criteria for a state law to be considered inconsistent, which includes preventing or significantly interfering with the purposes of the Act or being discriminatory in nature. The answer aligns with the information provided in the reference text.",
23,23,24,reg b,d562e9d6a8ee6aa4,How does the disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) relate to the independence requirements for appraisers and the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors?,"The disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) should not be interpreted to impact or change the legal, regulatory, or other standards concerning the independence of appraisers or the utilization of appraisals ordered by applicants by creditors.","If a creditor receives only one version of an
appraisal or other valuation that is developed in connection with the applicant's application, then that version must be
provided to the applicant to comply with § 1002.14(a)(1). See also comment 14(a)(1)-4 above.
1. Appraisal independence requirements not affected. Nothing in the text of the disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) should
be construed to affect, modify, limit, or supersede the operation of any legal, regulatory, or other requirements or standards
relating to independence in the conduct of appraisers or the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors.
2. Reasonable fee for reimbursement. Section 1002.14(a)(3) does not prohibit a creditor from imposing a reasonable fee to
reimburse the creditor's costs of the appraisal or other written valuation, so long as the fee is not increased to cover the
costs of providing copies of such appraisals or other written valuations under § 1002.14(a)(1). A creditor's cost may include
an administration fee charged to the creditor by an appraisal management company as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(11).
Section 1002.14(a)(3) does not, however, legally obligate the applicant to pay such fees. Further, creditors may not impose
fees for reimbursement of the costs of an appraisal or other valuation where otherwise prohibited by law. For instance, a
creditor may not charge a consumer a fee for the performance of a second appraisal if the second appraisal is required
under 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2) and 12 CFR 1026.35(c).
1. State law governs. When a contractual obligation on the consumer's part is created is a matter to be determined under
applicable law; § 1002.14 does not make this determination. A contractual commitment agreement, for example, that under
applicable law binds the consumer to the credit terms would be consummation. Consummation, however, does not occur
merely because the consumer has made some financial investment in the transaction (for example, by paying a
nonrefundable fee) unless, of course, applicable law holds otherwise.
2. Credit vs.

Similarly, creditors that are covered
financial institutions under subpart B of this Regulation may also be required to collect, report, and maintain certain data, as
set forth in subpart B of this Regulation.
6. Inadvertent notation. If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information in a dwelling-related transaction not
covered by § 1002.13, the creditor may process and retain the application without violating the regulation.
1. Procedures for providing disclosures. The disclosure to an applicant regarding the monitoring information may be provided
in writing. Appendix B provides data collection model forms for use in complying with § 1002.13 and that comply with §
1002.13(c). A creditor may devise its own disclosure so long as it is substantially similar. The creditor need not orally
request the monitoring information if it is requested in writing.
1. Multiple applicants. If there is more than one applicant, the written disclosure about written appraisals, and the copies of
appraisals and other written valuations, need only be given to one applicant. However, these materials must be given to the
primary applicant where one is readily apparent. Similarly, if there is more than one applicant for credit in the transaction,
one applicant may provide a waiver under § 1002.14(a)(1), but it must be the primary applicant where one is readily
apparent.
2. Renewals. Section 1002.14(a)(1) applies when an applicant requests the renewal of an existing extension of credit and the
creditor develops a new appraisal or other written valuation. Section 1002.14(a)(1) does not apply to the extent a creditor
uses the appraisals and other written valuations that were previously developed in connection with the prior extension of
credit to evaluate the renewal request.
3. Written. For purposes of § 1002.14, an “appraisal or other written valuation” includes, without limitation, an appraisal or
other valuation received or developed by the creditor in paper form (hard copy); electronically, such as CD or email; or by any
other similar media. See § 1002.14(a)(5) regarding the provision of copies of appraisals and other written valuations to
applicants via electronic means.
4. Timing.",1,True,,How does the disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) relate to the independence requirements for appraisers and the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors?,"The disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) is related to the independence requirements for appraisers and the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors in the context of ensuring that appraisals are conducted objectively and without any conflicts of interest. This disclosure helps maintain transparency in the appraisal process, ensuring that appraisers are independent and that applicant-ordered appraisals are used appropriately by creditors to make fair and unbiased lending decisions.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Any references in these procedures to options, judgment, etc.,
of “examiners” means discretion within the limits provided by
that examiner’s agency. An examiner should use these
procedures in conjunction with his, or her, own agency’s
priorities, examination philosophy, and detailed guidance for
implementing these procedures. These procedures should not
be interpreted as providing the examiner greater latitude than
his, or her, own agency would. For example, if an agency’s
policy is to review compliance management systems in all of
its institutions, an examiner for that agency must conduct such
a review rather than interpret Part II of these interagency
procedures as leaving the review to the examiner’s option.
The procedures emphasize racial and national origin
discrimination in residential transactions, but the key
principles are applicable to other prohibited bases and
to nonresidential transactions.
Finally, these procedures focus on analyzing
institution compliance with the broad,
nondiscrimination requirements of the ECOA and the
FHAct. They do not address such explicit or
technical compliance provisions as the signature rules
or adverse action notice requirements in Sections
1002.7 and 1002.9, respectively, of Regulation B.
Part I — Examination Scope Guidelines Background
Consistent with the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council Interagency Fair Lending Examination
Procedures, FDIC examiners evaluate fair lending risk
during the scoping process by completing three general
steps:
1. Examiners develop an institutional overview to assess an
institution’s inherent fair lending risk. As part of this
process, examiners become familiar with an institution’s
structure and management, supervisory history, loan
portfolio, and credit and market operations. Once examiners
understand a financial institution’s lending operations they
can identify the level of inherent risk. Inherent risk for fair
lending is broad-based and would impact a range of products
if no controls or other mitigating factors were in place to
control the risk. Inherent risk arises from the general 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.4 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
conditions or the environment in which the institution
operates. The risk could be present based on an institution’s
structure, supervisory history, the composition of the loan
portfolio, and the credit and market operations
2. If an examiner believes that an institution has more than
minimal inherent fair lending risk, the examiner should then
identify the product(s) or product group(s) to review. The
products or product groups selected may differ based on the
type of discrimination. For example, for purposes of pricing,
an examiner may select HMDA loans for further review,
while for underwriting, the examiner may select consumer
loans. Examiners are not expected to review all products for
discrimination risk if there is more than minimal inherent
risk. Rather, examiners should use their judgment and
consider the following when deciding which loan products
warrant further review. Examiners would then identify any
discrimination risk factors and assess an institution’s
compliance management system (CMS) for fair lending.
Understanding the strength of an institution’s CMS is
necessary to properly assess whether an institution has
sufficiently mitigated applicable discrimination risk factors.
If there is minimal inherent risk, no additional analysis is
necessary and the fair lending review can conclude.
3. For those discrimination risk factors that have not been
fully mitigated, examiners compile a list of potential focal
points and identify which should be pursued as a focal point.
The FDIC has developed the Fair Lending Scope and
Conclusions Memorandum (FLSC) to implement a standard
nationwide format for documenting the scope and
conclusions of fair lending reviews. FLSC has been adopted
as a means of focusing the examiner’s attention to the areas
that pose the greatest unmanaged fair lending risk to the
institution. It incorporates the Interagency Fair Lending
Examination Procedures1 and assists in documenting the
types of fair lending risks that are present; the controls that
management has put in place to manage the risk; the
effectiveness of these controls; why the particular focal
point(s) are chosen; the level of review conducted; and the
results of any additional analysis that was conducted. The
FLSC is included in section IV-3.1 of this manual.
The scope of an examination encompasses the loan
product(s), market(s), decision center(s), time frame, and
prohibited basis and control group(s) to be analyzed during
the examination. These procedures refer to each potential
combination of those elements as a “focal point.” Setting the
scope of an examination involves, first, identifying all of the
potential focal points that appear worthwhile to examine.
Then, from among those, examiners select the Focal
Point(s) that will form the scope of the examination, based
on risk factors, priorities established in these procedures or
 1 The interagency examination procedures are presented in their entirety in Part
III of this section of the manual.
by their respective agencies, the record from past
examinations, and other relevant guidance. This phase
includes obtaining an overview of an institution’s
compliance management system as it relates to fair lending.
When selecting focal points for review, examiners may
determine that the institution has performed “self-tests” or
“self-evaluations” related to specific lending products. The
difference between “self-tests” and “self-evaluations” is
discussed in the Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations to
Streamline the Examination section of the Appendix.
Institutions must share all information regarding “selfevaluations” and certain limited information related to “selftests.” Institutions may choose to voluntarily disclose
additional information about “self-tests.” Examiners should
make sure that institutions understand that voluntarily
sharing the results of self-tests will result in a loss of
confidential status of these tests. Information from “selfevaluations” or “self-tests” may allow the scoping to be
streamlined. ",How does the disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) relate to the independence requirements for appraisers and the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors?,"The disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) is related to the independence requirements for appraisers and the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors in the context of ensuring that appraisers are free from influence or pressure that may affect their judgment when determining the value of a property. This disclosure helps maintain the integrity of the appraisal process and ensures that the information provided to the creditor is unbiased and accurate, ultimately contributing to fair lending practices.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.

example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Any references in these procedures to options, judgment, etc.,
of “examiners” means discretion within the limits provided by
that examiner’s agency. An examiner should use these
procedures in conjunction with his, or her, own agency’s
priorities, examination philosophy, and detailed guidance for
implementing these procedures. These procedures should not
be interpreted as providing the examiner greater latitude than
his, or her, own agency would. For example, if an agency’s
policy is to review compliance management systems in all of
its institutions, an examiner for that agency must conduct such
a review rather than interpret Part II of these interagency
procedures as leaving the review to the examiner’s option.
The procedures emphasize racial and national origin
discrimination in residential transactions, but the key
principles are applicable to other prohibited bases and
to nonresidential transactions.
Finally, these procedures focus on analyzing
institution compliance with the broad,
nondiscrimination requirements of the ECOA and the
FHAct. They do not address such explicit or
technical compliance provisions as the signature rules
or adverse action notice requirements in Sections
1002.7 and 1002.9, respectively, of Regulation B.
Part I — Examination Scope Guidelines Background
Consistent with the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council Interagency Fair Lending Examination
Procedures, FDIC examiners evaluate fair lending risk
during the scoping process by completing three general
steps:
1. Examiners develop an institutional overview to assess an
institution’s inherent fair lending risk. As part of this
process, examiners become familiar with an institution’s
structure and management, supervisory history, loan
portfolio, and credit and market operations. Once examiners
understand a financial institution’s lending operations they
can identify the level of inherent risk. Inherent risk for fair
lending is broad-based and would impact a range of products
if no controls or other mitigating factors were in place to
control the risk. Inherent risk arises from the general 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.4 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
conditions or the environment in which the institution
operates. The risk could be present based on an institution’s
structure, supervisory history, the composition of the loan
portfolio, and the credit and market operations
2. If an examiner believes that an institution has more than
minimal inherent fair lending risk, the examiner should then
identify the product(s) or product group(s) to review. The
products or product groups selected may differ based on the
type of discrimination. For example, for purposes of pricing,
an examiner may select HMDA loans for further review,
while for underwriting, the examiner may select consumer
loans. Examiners are not expected to review all products for
discrimination risk if there is more than minimal inherent
risk. Rather, examiners should use their judgment and
consider the following when deciding which loan products
warrant further review. Examiners would then identify any
discrimination risk factors and assess an institution’s
compliance management system (CMS) for fair lending.
Understanding the strength of an institution’s CMS is
necessary to properly assess whether an institution has
sufficiently mitigated applicable discrimination risk factors.
If there is minimal inherent risk, no additional analysis is
necessary and the fair lending review can conclude.
3. For those discrimination risk factors that have not been
fully mitigated, examiners compile a list of potential focal
points and identify which should be pursued as a focal point.
The FDIC has developed the Fair Lending Scope and
Conclusions Memorandum (FLSC) to implement a standard
nationwide format for documenting the scope and
conclusions of fair lending reviews. FLSC has been adopted
as a means of focusing the examiner’s attention to the areas
that pose the greatest unmanaged fair lending risk to the
institution. It incorporates the Interagency Fair Lending
Examination Procedures1 and assists in documenting the
types of fair lending risks that are present; the controls that
management has put in place to manage the risk; the
effectiveness of these controls; why the particular focal
point(s) are chosen; the level of review conducted; and the
results of any additional analysis that was conducted. The
FLSC is included in section IV-3.1 of this manual.
The scope of an examination encompasses the loan
product(s), market(s), decision center(s), time frame, and
prohibited basis and control group(s) to be analyzed during
the examination. These procedures refer to each potential
combination of those elements as a “focal point.” Setting the
scope of an examination involves, first, identifying all of the
potential focal points that appear worthwhile to examine.
Then, from among those, examiners select the Focal
Point(s) that will form the scope of the examination, based
on risk factors, priorities established in these procedures or
 1 The interagency examination procedures are presented in their entirety in Part
III of this section of the manual.
by their respective agencies, the record from past
examinations, and other relevant guidance. This phase
includes obtaining an overview of an institution’s
compliance management system as it relates to fair lending.
When selecting focal points for review, examiners may
determine that the institution has performed “self-tests” or
“self-evaluations” related to specific lending products. The
difference between “self-tests” and “self-evaluations” is
discussed in the Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations to
Streamline the Examination section of the Appendix.
Institutions must share all information regarding “selfevaluations” and certain limited information related to “selftests.” Institutions may choose to voluntarily disclose
additional information about “self-tests.” Examiners should
make sure that institutions understand that voluntarily
sharing the results of self-tests will result in a loss of
confidential status of these tests. Information from “selfevaluations” or “self-tests” may allow the scoping to be
streamlined. ",How does the disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) relate to the independence requirements for appraisers and the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors?,The disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) is related to the independence requirements for appraisers and the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors by ensuring that creditors provide applicants with a copy of any written appraisal or valuation developed in connection with an application for a loan that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling. This disclosure helps applicants understand the valuation of the property being used as collateral for the loan and promotes transparency in the lending process.,"This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in

planned comparisons.

the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and

involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is

type of discrimination. For example, for purposes of pricing,
an examiner may select HMDA loans for further review,
while for underwriting, the examiner may select consumer
loans. Examiners are not expected to review all products for
discrimination risk if there is more than minimal inherent
risk. Rather, examiners should use their judgment and
consider the following when deciding which loan products
warrant further review. Examiners would then identify any
discrimination risk factors and assess an institution’s
compliance management system (CMS) for fair lending.
Understanding the strength of an institution’s CMS is
necessary to properly assess whether an institution has
sufficiently mitigated applicable discrimination risk factors.
If there is minimal inherent risk, no additional analysis is
necessary and the fair lending review can conclude.
3. For those discrimination risk factors that have not been
fully mitigated, examiners compile a list of potential focal
points and identify which should be pursued as a focal point.
The FDIC has developed the Fair Lending Scope and
Conclusions Memorandum (FLSC) to implement a standard
nationwide format for documenting the scope and
conclusions of fair lending reviews. FLSC has been adopted
as a means of focusing the examiner’s attention to the areas
that pose the greatest unmanaged fair lending risk to the
institution. It incorporates the Interagency Fair Lending
Examination Procedures1 and assists in documenting the
types of fair lending risks that are present; the controls that
management has put in place to manage the risk; the
effectiveness of these controls; why the particular focal
point(s) are chosen; the level of review conducted; and the
results of any additional analysis that was conducted. The
FLSC is included in section IV-3.1 of this manual.
The scope of an examination encompasses the loan
product(s), market(s), decision center(s), time frame, and
prohibited basis and control group(s) to be analyzed during
the examination. These procedures refer to each potential
combination of those elements as a “focal point.” Setting the
scope of an examination involves, first, identifying all of the
potential focal points that appear worthwhile to examine.
Then, from among those, examiners select the Focal
Point(s) that will form the scope of the examination, based
on risk factors, priorities established in these procedures or
 1 The interagency examination procedures are presented in their entirety in Part
III of this section of the manual.
by their respective agencies, the record from past
examinations, and other relevant guidance. This phase
includes obtaining an overview of an institution’s
compliance management system as it relates to fair lending.
When selecting focal points for review, examiners may
determine that the institution has performed “self-tests” or
“self-evaluations” related to specific lending products. The
difference between “self-tests” and “self-evaluations” is
discussed in the Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations to
Streamline the Examination section of the Appendix.
Institutions must share all information regarding “selfevaluations” and certain limited information related to “selftests.” Institutions may choose to voluntarily disclose
additional information about “self-tests.” Examiners should
make sure that institutions understand that voluntarily
sharing the results of self-tests will result in a loss of
confidential status of these tests. Information from “selfevaluations” or “self-tests” may allow the scoping to be
streamlined. ",correct,The answer correctly explains that the disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) is related to the independence requirements for appraisers and the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors. It mentions the importance of maintaining transparency in the appraisal process to ensure objectivity and fair lending decisions. The answer addresses the key points of the question by linking the disclosure to independence and fairness in the context of appraisals.,

under section 704 of the Act may be substituted for the requirements contained in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this
section.
(a) Providing appraisals and other valuations —
(1) In general. A creditor shall provide an applicant a copy of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in
connection with an application for credit that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling. A creditor shall provide a
copy of each such appraisal or other written valuation promptly upon completion, or three business days prior to
consummation of the transaction (for closed-end credit) or account opening (for open-end credit), whichever is earlier.
An applicant may waive the timing requirement in this paragraph (a)(1) and agree to receive any copy at or before
consummation or account opening, except where otherwise prohibited by law. Any such waiver must be obtained at
least three business days prior to consummation or account opening, unless the waiver pertains solely to the
applicant's receipt of a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that contains only clerical changes from a
previous version of the appraisal or other written valuation provided to the applicant three or more business days prior
to consummation or account opening. If the applicant provides a waiver and the transaction is not consummated or
the account is not opened, the creditor must provide these copies no later than 30 days after the creditor determines
consummation will not occur or the account will not be opened.
(2) Disclosure. For applications subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a creditor shall mail or deliver to an applicant,
not later than the third business day after the creditor receives an application for credit that is to be secured by a first
lien on a dwelling, a notice in writing of the applicant's right to receive a copy of all written appraisals developed in
connection with the application.

If the applicant provides a waiver and the transaction is not consummated or
the account is not opened, the creditor must provide these copies no later than 30 days after the creditor determines
consummation will not occur or the account will not be opened.
(2) Disclosure. For applications subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a creditor shall mail or deliver to an applicant,
not later than the third business day after the creditor receives an application for credit that is to be secured by a first
lien on a dwelling, a notice in writing of the applicant's right to receive a copy of all written appraisals developed in
connection with the application. In the case of an application for credit that is not to be secured by a first lien on a
dwelling at the time of application, if the creditor later determines the credit will be secured by a first lien on a dwelling,
the creditor shall mail or deliver the same notice in writing not later than the third business day after the creditor
determines that the loan is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling.
(3) Reimbursement. A creditor shall not charge an applicant for providing a copy of appraisals and other written valuations
as required under this section, but may require applicants to pay a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost
of the appraisal or other written valuation unless otherwise provided by law.
(4) Withdrawn, denied, or incomplete applications. The requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply
whether credit is extended or denied or if the application is incomplete or withdrawn.
(5) Copies in electronic form. The copies required by § 1002.14(a)(1) may be provided to the applicant in electronic form,
subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in
Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.).

Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to

has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
",correct,"The answer correctly states that a creditor can collect information regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of a second or additional co-applicant for a covered loan under 12 CFR 1003.2(e) if it is required to collect the information under Regulation B for monitoring purposes or to ensure compliance with fair lending laws. This aligns with the conditions mentioned in the reference text.",
26,26,27,reg b,0e4c2d11300eeb38,What are the criteria for a financial institution to be classified as a covered financial institution under § 1002.105(b)?,A financial institution is classified as a covered financial institution under § 1002.105(b) if it originated at least 100 covered credit transactions for small businesses during the two preceding calendar years.,"1. Examples. Section 1002.105(a) defines a financial institution as any partnership, company, corporation,
association (incorporated or unincorporated), trust, estate, cooperative organization, or other entity
that engages in any financial activity. This definition includes, but is not limited to, banks, savings
associations, credit unions, online lenders, platform lenders, community development financial
institutions, Farm Credit System lenders, lenders involved in equipment and vehicle financing (captive
financing companies and independent financing companies), commercial finance companies,
organizations exempt from taxation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 501(c), and governments or governmental
subdivisions or agencies.
2. Motor vehicle dealers. Pursuant to § 1002.101(a), subpart B of this part excludes from coverage
persons defined by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, title X of the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 2004
(2010).
1. Preceding calendar year. The definition of covered financial institution refers to preceding calendar
years. For example, in 2029, the two preceding calendar years are 2027 and 2028. Accordingly, in 2029,
Financial Institution A does not meet the loan-volume threshold in § 1002.105(b) if did not originate at
least 100 covered credit transactions for small businesses both during 2027 and during 2028.

https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-X/part-1002 91/130
2. Origination threshold. A financial institution qualifies as a covered financial institution based on total
covered credit transactions originated for small businesses, rather than covered applications received
from small businesses. For example, if in both 2024 and 2025, Financial Institution B received 105
covered applications from small businesses and originated 95 covered credit transactions for small
businesses, then for 2026, Financial Institution B is not a covered financial institution.
3.

See appendix E for sample language.
1. Subsidiaries. A covered financial institution is considered a subsidiary of another covered financial institution for purposes
of reporting data pursuant to § 1002.109 if more than 50 percent of the ownership or control of the first covered financial
institution is held by the second covered financial institution.
1. General. The following clarifies how to report applications involving more than one financial institution. The discussion
below assumes that all parties involved with the covered credit transaction are covered financial institutions. However, the
same principles apply if any party is not a covered financial institution.
i. A financial institution shall report the action that it takes on a covered application, whether or not the covered credit
transaction closed in the financial institution's name and even if the financial institution used underwriting criteria
supplied by another financial institution. However, where it is necessary for more than one financial institution to make
a credit decision in order to approve a single covered credit transaction, only the last financial institution with authority
to set the material terms of the covered credit transaction is required to report. Setting the material terms of the
covered credit transaction include, for example, selecting among competing offers, or modifying pricing information,
amount approved or originated, or repayment duration. In this situation, the determinative factor is not which financial
institution actually made the last credit decision prior to closing, but rather which financial institution last had the
authority for setting the material terms of the covered credit transaction prior to closing. Whether a financial institution
has taken action for purposes of § 1002.109(a)(3) and comment 109(a)(3)-1 is not relevant to, and is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with, section 701(d) (15 U.S.C. 1691(d)) of the Act, § 1002.9, or any other
provision within subpart A of this Regulation.
ii. A financial institution takes action on a covered application for purposes of § 1002.109(a)(3) if it denies the
application, originates the application, approves the application but the applicant did not accept the transaction, or
closes the file or denies for incompleteness. The financial institution must also report the application if it was
withdrawn.",1,True,,What are the criteria for a financial institution to be classified as a covered financial institution under § 1002.105(b)?,"The criteria for a financial institution to be classified as a covered financial institution under § 1002.105(b) include having a certain number of employees, conducting a certain volume of business, and being involved in residential real estate-related transactions.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

",What are the criteria for a financial institution to be classified as a covered financial institution under § 1002.105(b)?,"The criteria for a financial institution to be classified as a covered financial institution under § 1002.105(b) include having a certain number of employees, operating in specific geographic areas, and meeting certain transaction thresholds related to residential mortgage loans.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

the application on its small business lending application register pursuant to § 1002.109.
2. Change in determination of small business status—business is ultimately a small business. Consistent
with comment 107(a)(14)-1, a financial institution need not independently verify gross annual revenue.
If a financial institution initially determines that the applicant is not a small business as defined in §
1002.106(b), but later concludes the applicant is a small business prior to taking final action on the
application, the financial institution must report the covered application pursuant to § 1002.109. In this
situation, the financial institution shall endeavor to compile, maintain, and report the data required
under § 1002.107(a) in a manner that is reasonable under the circumstances. For example, if the
applicant initially provides a gross annual revenue of $5.5 million (that is, above the threshold for a
small business as initially defined in § 1002.106(b)(1)), but during the course of underwriting the
financial institution discovers the applicant's gross annual revenue was in fact $4.75 million (meaning
that the applicant is within the definition of a small business under § 1002.106(b)), the financial
institution is required to report the covered application pursuant to § 1002.109. In this situation, the
financial institution shall take reasonable steps upon discovery to compile, maintain, and report the
data necessary under § 1002.107(a) to comply with subpart B of this part for that covered application.
Thus, in this example, even if the financial institution's procedure is typically to request applicant-
provided data together with the application form, in this circumstance, the financial institution shall
seek to collect the data during the application process necessary to comply with subpart B in a manner
that is reasonable under the circumstances.
3. Applicant's representations regarding gross annual revenue; inclusion of affiliate revenue; updated or
verified information. A financial institution is permitted to rely on an applicant's representations
regarding gross annual revenue (which may or may not include any affiliate's revenue) for purposes of
determining small business status under § 1002.106(b).

In this situation, the
financial institution shall take reasonable steps upon discovery to compile, maintain, and report the
data necessary under § 1002.107(a) to comply with subpart B of this part for that covered application.
Thus, in this example, even if the financial institution's procedure is typically to request applicant-
provided data together with the application form, in this circumstance, the financial institution shall
seek to collect the data during the application process necessary to comply with subpart B in a manner
that is reasonable under the circumstances.
3. Applicant's representations regarding gross annual revenue; inclusion of affiliate revenue; updated or
verified information. A financial institution is permitted to rely on an applicant's representations
regarding gross annual revenue (which may or may not include any affiliate's revenue) for purposes of
determining small business status under § 1002.106(b). However, if the applicant provides updated
gross annual revenue information or the financial institution verifies the gross annual revenue
information (see comment 107(b)-1), the financial institution must use the updated or verified
information in determining small business status.
4. Multiple unaffiliated co-applicants—size determination. The financial institution shall not aggregate
unaffiliated co-applicants' gross annual revenues for purposes of determining small business status
under § 1002.106(b). If a covered financial institution receives a covered application from multiple
businesses who are not affiliates, as defined by § 1002.102(a), where at least one business is a small
business under § 1002.106(b), the financial institution shall compile, maintain, and report data
pursuant to §§ 1002.107 through 1002.109 regarding the covered application for only a single
applicant that is a small business. See comment 103(a)-10 for additional details.
1. Inflation adjustment methodology. The small business gross annual revenue threshold set forth in §
1002.106(b)(1) will be adjusted upward or downward to reflect changes, if any, in the Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers (U.S. city average series for all items, not seasonally adjusted), as
published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (“CPI-U”).",1,True,,How does a financial institution determine small business status based on an applicant's representations of gross annual revenue?,"By focusing on commercial applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in the preceding fiscal year, a financial institution determines small business status based on an applicant's representations of gross annual revenue.","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","c. How and when the statement or practice was
disseminated or put into effect.
d. How widely the statement or practice was disseminated
or applied.
e. Whether and to what extent applicants were
adversely affected by the statement or practice.
Assemble findings and supporting documentation for
presentation to management in connection with Part IV of
these procedures.
C. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Residential and
Consumer Loans.
Step 1. Set Sample Size
a. For each focal point selected for this analysis, two
samples will be utilized: (i) prohibited basis group denials
and (ii) control group approvals, both identified either
directly from monitoring information in the case of
residential loan applications or through the use of
application data or surrogates in the case of consumer
applications.
b. Refer to Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table A in the
Appendix and determine the size of the initial sample for
each focal point, based on the number of prohibited basis
group denials and the number of control group approvals
by the institution during the twelve month (or calendar
year) period of lending activity preceding the
examination.
In the event that the number of denials and/or approvals
acted on during the preceding 12 month period
substantially exceeds the maximum sample size shown
in Table A, reduce the time period from which that
sample is selected to a shorter period. (In doing so,
make every effort to select a period in which the
institution’s underwriting standards are most
representative of those in effect during the full 12
month period preceding the examination.)
c. If the number of prohibited basis group denials or
control group approvals for a given focal point that were
acted upon during the 12 month period referenced in
1.b., above, do not meet the minimum standards set forth
in the Sample Size Table, examiners need not attempt a
transactional analysis for that focal point. Where other
risk factors favor analyzing such a focal point, consult
with agency supervisory staff on possible alternative
methods of judgmental comparative analysis.
d. If agency policy calls for a different approach to
sampling (e.g., a form of statistical analysis, a
mathematical formula, or an automated tool) for a
limited class of institutions, examiners should follow
that approach.
Step 2. Determine Sample Composition
a. To the extent the institution maintains records of loan
outcomes resulting from exceptions to its credit
underwriting standards or other policies (e.g., overrides
to credit score cutoffs), request such records for both
approvals and denials, sorted by loan product and
branch or decision center, if the institution can do so.
Include in the initial sample for each focal point all
exceptions or overrides applicable to that focal point.
b. Using HMDA/LAR data or, for consumer loans,
comparable loan register data to the extent
available, choose approved and denied
applications based on selection criteria that will
maximize the likelihood of finding marginal
approved and denied applicants, as discussed
below.
c. To the extent that the above factors are inapplicable or
other selection criteria are unavailable or do not
facilitate selection of the entire sample size of files,
complete the initial sample selection by making random
file selections from the appropriate sample categories in
the Sample Size Table.

FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.1
Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.

Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants

NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or

The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these

",incorrect,"The answer provided does not specifically mention New York or credit terms and conditions being preempted by Federal law. It only mentions Ohio and the regulation of credit terms and conditions. Therefore, the answer does not address the question regarding New York state law provisions being preempted by Federal law.",
29,29,30,reg b,42432b488514adab,In what situations is it permissible for a creditor to consider a borrower's age in evaluating creditworthiness?,"A creditor may consider a borrower's age in evaluating creditworthiness when determining a pertinent element of creditworthiness, such as the amount of credit or monthly payments the borrower will receive, or the estimated repayment date. Additionally, a creditor may consider the age of an elderly applicant when such age is used to favor the elderly applicant in extending credit.","As the following examples illustrate, the evaluation must be made in an individualized, case-by-case
manner:
i. A creditor may consider the applicant's occupation and length of time to retirement to ascertain whether the
applicant's income (including retirement income) will support the extension of credit to its maturity.
5/26/24, 10:39 PM eCFR :: 12 CFR Part 1002 -- Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B)
https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-X/part-1002 64/130
Paragraph 6(b)(5).
ii. A creditor may consider the adequacy of any security offered when the term of the credit extension exceeds the life
expectancy of the applicant and the cost of realizing on the collateral could exceed the applicant's equity. An elderly
applicant might not qualify for a 5 percent down, 30-year mortgage loan but might qualify with a larger downpayment
or a shorter loan maturity.
iii. A creditor may consider the applicant's age to assess the significance of length of employment (a young applicant may
have just entered the job market) or length of time at an address (an elderly applicant may recently have retired and
moved from a long-term residence).
4. Consideration of age in a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan in which the borrower receives
payments from the creditor, and does not become obligated to repay these amounts (other than in the case of default) until
the borrower dies, moves permanently from the home, or transfers title to the home, or upon a specified maturity date.
Disbursements to the borrower under a reverse mortgage typically are determined by considering the value of the
borrower's home, the current interest rate, and the borrower's life expectancy. A reverse mortgage program that requires
borrowers to be age 62 or older is permissible under § 1002.6(b)(2)(iv). In addition, under § 1002.6(b)(2)(iii), a creditor may
consider a borrower's age to evaluate a pertinent element of creditworthiness, such as the amount of the credit or monthly
payments that the borrower will receive, or the estimated repayment date.
5. Consideration of age in a combined system.

(1) Except as provided in the Act and this part, a creditor shall not take a prohibited basis into account in any system of
evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants.
(2) Age, receipt of public assistance.
(i) Except as permitted in this paragraph, a creditor shall not take into account an applicant's age (provided that the
applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract) or whether an applicant's income derives from any
public assistance program.
(ii) In an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, a creditor may use an
applicant's age as a predictive variable, provided that the age of an elderly applicant is not assigned a negative
factor or value.
(iii) In a judgmental system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider an applicant's age or whether an
applicant's income derives from any public assistance program only for the purpose of determining a pertinent
element of creditworthiness.
(iv) In any system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider the age of an elderly applicant when such
age is used to favor the elderly applicant in extending credit.
(3) Childbearing, childrearing. In evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor shall not make assumptions or use aggregate
statistics relating to the likelihood that any category of persons will bear or rear children or will, for that reason, receive
diminished or interrupted income in the future.
(4) Telephone listing. A creditor shall not take into account whether there is a telephone listing in the name of an applicant
for consumer credit but may take into account whether there is a telephone in the applicant's residence.
(5) Income. A creditor shall not discount or exclude from consideration the income of an applicant or the spouse of an
applicant because of a prohibited basis or because the income is derived from part-time employment or is an annuity,
pension, or other retirement benefit; a creditor may consider the amount and probable continuance of any income in
evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness. When an applicant relies on alimony, child support, or separate
maintenance payments in applying for credit, the creditor shall consider such payments as income to the extent that
they are likely to be consistently made.
(6) Credit history.",1,True,,In what situations is it permissible for a creditor to consider a borrower's age in evaluating creditworthiness?,"It is permissible for a creditor to consider a borrower's age in evaluating creditworthiness if the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which scores age for any loan product selected for review in the scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or only as a guide to making loan decisions.","I. Credit Scoring.
If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
J. Disparate Impact Issues.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.10 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

",correct,The answer provided correctly explains that a creditor may consider a borrower's age in evaluating creditworthiness if they use a credit scoring program that includes age as a predictive variable. The answer also mentions that age can be used as a guide in making loan decisions.

30,30,31,reg b,59cc22270b81256f,What criteria must an individual meet in order to be considered a principal owner of a business for the purposes of subpart B of the document? Include details about ownership percentage and indirect ownership considerations.,An individual must directly own an equity share of 25 percent or more in the business to be considered a principal owner for the purposes of subpart B. Indirect ownership is not taken into account when determining if someone is a principal owner. Ownership is not traced through multiple corporate structures to establish if an individual owns 25 percent or more of the equity interests.,"1. Individual. Only an individual can be a principal owner of a business for purposes of subpart B of this
part. Entities, such as trusts, partnerships, limited liability companies, and corporations, are not
principal owners for this purpose. Additionally, an individual must directly own an equity share of 25
percent or more in the business in order to be a principal owner. Unlike the determination of ownership
for purposes of collecting and reporting minority-owned business status, women-owned business
status, and LGBTQI+-owned business status, indirect ownership is not considered when determining if
someone is a principal owner for purposes of collecting and reporting principal owners' ethnicity, race,
and sex or the number of principal owners. Thus, when determining who is a principal owner,
ownership is not traced through multiple corporate structures to determine if an individual owns 25
percent or more of the equity interests. For example, if individual A directly owns 20 percent of a
business, individual B directly owns 20 percent, and partnership C owns 60 percent, the business does
not have any owners who satisfy the definition of principal owner set forth in § 1002.102(o), even if
individual A and individual B are the only partners in the partnership C. Similarly, if individual A directly
owns 30 percent of a business, individual B directly owns 20 percent, and trust D owns 50 percent,
individual A is the only principal owner as defined in § 1002.102(o), even if individual B is the sole
trustee of trust D.
2. Trustee. Although a trust is not considered a principal owner of a business for the purposes of subpart
B, if the applicant for a covered credit transaction is a trust, a trustee is considered the owner of the
trust. Thus, if a trust is an applicant for a covered credit transaction and the trust has two co-trustees,
each co-trustee is considered to own 50 percent of the business and would each be a principal owner
as defined in § 1002.102(o). In contrast, if the trust has five co-trustees, each co-trustee is considered
to own 20 percent of the business and would not meet the definition of principal owner under §
1002.102(o).
3. Purpose of definition.

2. Trustee. Although a trust is not considered a principal owner of a business for the purposes of subpart
B, if the applicant for a covered credit transaction is a trust, a trustee is considered the owner of the
trust. Thus, if a trust is an applicant for a covered credit transaction and the trust has two co-trustees,
each co-trustee is considered to own 50 percent of the business and would each be a principal owner
as defined in § 1002.102(o). In contrast, if the trust has five co-trustees, each co-trustee is considered
to own 20 percent of the business and would not meet the definition of principal owner under §
1002.102(o).
3. Purpose of definition. A financial institution shall provide an applicant with the definition of principal
owner when asking the applicant to provide the number of its principal owners pursuant to §
1002.107(a)(20) and the ethnicity, race, and sex of its principal owners pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(19).
See comments 107(a)(19)-2 and 107(a)(20)-1.
1. General. In order to be a women-owned business for purposes of subpart B of this part, a business
must satisfy both prongs of the definition of women-owned business. First, one or more women must
own or control more than 50 percent of the business. However, it is not necessary that one or more
women both own and control more than 50 percent of the business. For example, a business that is
owned entirely by women but is not controlled by any women satisfies the first prong of the definition.

questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of

Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

Include details about ownership percentage and indirect ownership considerations.,"To be considered a principal owner of a business for the purposes of subpart B of the document, an individual must meet specific criteria. This includes having an ownership interest of 25% or more in the business. Additionally, indirect ownership through entities such as trusts, corporations, or other legal structures should also be taken into account when determining principal ownership status.","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.

points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a

Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,

borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.

credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the

the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

Include details about ownership percentage and indirect ownership considerations.,"To be considered a principal owner of a business for the purposes of subpart B of the document, an individual must meet specific criteria. This includes having an ownership interest of 25% or more in the business. Additionally, indirect ownership through entities such as trusts, estates, corporations, or partnerships should also be taken into account when determining principal ownership status.","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate

characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.

residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek

written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)

",incorrect,"The answer correctly addresses the criteria for an individual to be considered a principal owner of a business for the purposes of subpart B. It mentions the requirement of having an ownership interest of 25% or more in the business, which is in line with the reference text. However, it inaccurately states that indirect ownership through entities such as trusts, estates, corporations, or partnerships should be considered for determining principal ownership status, which contradicts the reference text that explicitly states indirect ownership is not considered for this purpose.",

In such cases, the reporting financial institution should report the denial reason(s) from the first financial institution that denied the covered application. This ensures consistency in reporting when there are multiple denials from different financial institutions involved in the credit decision process.","Where it is necessary for more than one financial institution to make a credit decision in order to approve a single
covered credit transaction and where more than one financial institution denies the application or otherwise does not
approve the application, the reporting financial institution (the last financial institution with authority to set the material
terms of the covered credit transaction) shall have a consistent procedure for determining how it reports inconsistent
or differing data points for purposes of subpart B. For example, Financial Institution A is the reporting entity because it
has the last authority to set the material credit terms. Financial Institution A sends the application to Financial
Institution B and Financial Institution C for review, but both Financial Institution B and Financial Institution C deny the
application, with different denial reasons. Based on these denials, Financial Institution A follows suit and denies the
application. Financial Institution A must have a consistent procedure for what denial reason(s) to report, such as
reporting the denial reason(s) from the first financial institution that denied the covered application.
2. Examples. The following scenarios illustrate how a financial institution reports a particular covered application. The
illustrations assume that all parties involved with the covered credit transaction are covered financial institutions. However,
the same principles apply if any party is not a covered financial institution. Examples i through iv involve a single financial
institution with responsibility for making a credit decision without the involvement of an intermediary. Example v describes
a financial institution intermediary with only passive involvement in the covered credit transaction. Example vi describes a
transaction where multiple financial institutions independently decision and take action on a covered application. Examples
vii and viii describe situations where more than one financial institution must make a credit decision in order to approve the
covered credit transaction. Examples ix and x describe situations involving pooled and participation interests.
i. Financial Institution A received a covered application from an applicant and approved the application before closing
the covered credit transaction in its name. Financial Institution A was not acting as Financial Institution B's agent.
Financial Institution B later purchased the covered credit transaction from Financial Institution A. Financial Institution
A was not acting as Financial Institution B's agent. Financial Institution A reports the application. Financial Institution
B has no reporting obligation for this transaction.
ii. Financial Institution A received a covered application from an applicant. If approved, the covered credit transaction
would have closed in Financial Institution B's name.

vi. Financial Institution A received a covered application and forwarded it to Financial Institutions B and C. Financial
Institution A made a credit decision, acting as Financial Institution D's agent, and approved the application. Financial
Institutions B and C are not working together with Financial Institutions A or D, or with each other, and are solely
responsible for setting the terms of their own credit transactions. Financial Institution B made a credit decision
approving the application, and Financial Institution C made a credit decision denying the application. The applicant did
not accept the covered credit transaction from Financial Institution D. Financial Institution D reports the application as
approved but not accepted. Financial Institution A does not report the application, because it was acting as Financial

Specific information about the principal owners, purpose of the loan, and financial details of the commercial enterprise must be recorded. Additionally, the institution should select approved loans similar to the denied ones in terms of business type, loan purpose, amount, terms, and collateral. Information parallel to that obtained for denied applications should be recorded for approved commercial loan applications. Any deviations from credit standards and differences in loan terms granted for approved requests should be identified and discussed with the commercial credit underwriter. If deviations are not explained, the examiner should determine if they were detrimental to any protected classes of applicants and consider further sampling to assess for discriminatory practices.","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.

Step 3. Compare Approved and Denied Applications
Overview: Although a creditor’s written policies and
procedures may appear to be nondiscriminatory, lending
personnel may interpret or apply policies in a
discriminatory manner. In order to detect any disparate
treatment among applicants, the examiner should first
eliminate all but “marginal transactions” (see 3.b. below)
from each selected focal point sample. Then, a detailed
profile of each marginal applicant’s qualifications, the
level of assistance received during the application process,
the reasons for denial, the loan terms, and other
information should be recorded on an Applicant Profile
Spreadsheet. Once profiled, the examiner can compare the
target and control groups for evidence that similarly
qualified applicants have been treated differently as to
either the institution’s credit decision or the quality of
assistance provided.
a. Create Applicant Profile Spreadsheet
Based upon the institution’s written and/or articulated
credit standards and loan policies, identify categories of
data that should be recorded for each applicant and
provide a field for each of these categories on a
worksheet or computerized spreadsheet. Certain data
(income, loan amount, debt, etc.) should always be
included in the spreadsheet, while the other data
selected will be tailored for each loan product and
institution based on applicable underwriting criteria
and such issues as branch location and underwriter.
Where credit bureau scores and/or application scores
are an element of the institution’s underwriting criteria
(or where such information is regularly recorded in
loan files, whether expressly used or not), include a
data field for this information in the spread sheet.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the quality of
assistance provided to target and control group applicants,
respectively, every work sheet should provide a
“comments” block appropriately labeled as the site for
recording observations from the file or interviews
regarding how an applicant was, or was not, assisted in
overcoming credit deficiencies or otherwise qualifying for
approval.
b. Complete Applicant Profiles
From the application files sample for each focal point,
complete applicant profiles for selected denied and
approved applications as follows:
• A principal goal is to identify cases where similarly
qualified prohibited basis and control group
applicants had different credit outcomes, because the
agencies have found that discrimination, including
differences in granting assistance during the approval
process, is more likely to occur with respect to
applicants who are not either clearly qualified or
unqualified ( i.e., “marginal” applicants). The
examiner-in-charge should, during the following
steps, judgmentally select from the initial sample
only those denied and approved applications which
constitute marginal transactions. (See Appendix on
Identifying Marginal Transactions for guidance)
• If few marginal control group applicants are identified
from the initial sample, review additional files of
approved control group applicants. This will either
increase the number of marginal approvals or confirm that
marginal approvals are so infrequent that the marginal
denials are unlikely to involve disparate treatment.
• The judgmental selection of both marginal-denied and
marginal-approved applicant loan files should be done
together, in a “back and forth” manner, to facilitate
close matches and a more consistent definition of
“marginal” between these two types of loan files.
• Once the marginal files have been identified, the data
elements called for on the profile spreadsheet are
extracted or noted and entered.
• While conducting the preceding step, the examiner
should simultaneously look for and document on the
spreadsheet any evidence found in marginal files
regarding the following:
° the extent of any assistance, including both
affirmative aid and waivers or partial waivers of
credit policy provisions or requirements, that
appears to have been provided to marginalapproved control group applicants which enabled
them to overcome one or more credit deficiencies,
such as excessive debt-to-income ratios; and
° the extent to which marginal-denied target group
applicants with similar deficiencies were, or were
not, provided similar affirmative aid, waivers or
other forms of assistance.
c. Review and Compare Profiles
• For each focal point, review all marginal profiles to determine
if the underwriter followed institution lending policies in
denying applications and whether the reason(s) for denial were
supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly
disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If any (a)
unexplained deviations from credit standards, (b) inaccurate
reasons for denial or (c) incorrect disclosures are noted,
(whether in a judgmental underwriting system, a scored
system or a mixed system) the examiner should obtain an
explanation from the underwriter and document the response
on an appropriate workpaper.
NOTE: In constructing the applicant profiles to be
compared, examiners must adjust the facts compared so that
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.15
assistance, waivers, or acts of discretion are treated
consistently between applicants. For example, if a control
group applicant’s DTI ratio was lowered to 42% because
the institution decided to include short-term overtime
income and a prohibited basis group applicant who was
denied due to “insufficient income” would have had his
ratio drop from 46% to 41% if his short-term overtime
income had been considered, then the examiners should
consider 41%, not 46%, in determining the benchmark.
• For each reason for denial identified within the target
group, rank the denied prohibited basis applicants,
beginning with the applicant whose qualification(s)
related to that reason for denial were least deficient.
(The top-ranked denied applicant in each such ranking
will be referred to below as the “benchmark”
applicant.)
• Compare each marginal control group approval to the
benchmark applicant in each reason-for-denial ranking
developed in step (b), above. If there are no approvals
who are equally or less qualified, then there are no
instances of disparate treatment for the institution to
account for. For all such approvals that appear no better
qualified than the denied benchmark applicant
o identify the approved loan on the worksheet or
spreadsheet as an “overlap approval,” and
o compare that overlap approval with other
marginal prohibited basis denials in the ranking to
determine whether additional overlaps exist. If
so, identify all overlapping approvals and denials
as above.
• Where the focal point involves use of a credit scoring
system, the analysis for disparate treatment is similar to
the procedures set forth in (c) above, and should focus
primarily on overrides of the scoring system itself. For
guidance on this type of analysis, refer to Considering
Automated Underwriting and Credit Scoring, Part C in
the Appendix.
",Explain the procedure that a reporting financial institution must follow when multiple financial institutions deny a covered credit application.,"The reporting financial institution must conduct a comparative file review by selecting denied applications from businesses located in minority or integrated geographies or owned by women or minority group members. Specific information about the principal owners, purpose of the loan, and financial details of the commercial enterprise must be recorded. Additionally, the institution should select approved loans similar to the denied ones and obtain parallel information for comparison. Any deviations from credit standards and differences in loan terms granted should be identified and discussed with the commercial credit underwriter. If deviations are not explained, the examiner should determine if they were detrimental to any protected classes of applicants and further investigate for potential discrimination.","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.

(income, loan amount, debt, etc.) should always be
included in the spreadsheet, while the other data
selected will be tailored for each loan product and
institution based on applicable underwriting criteria
and such issues as branch location and underwriter.
Where credit bureau scores and/or application scores
are an element of the institution’s underwriting criteria
(or where such information is regularly recorded in
loan files, whether expressly used or not), include a
data field for this information in the spread sheet.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the quality of
assistance provided to target and control group applicants,
respectively, every work sheet should provide a
“comments” block appropriately labeled as the site for
recording observations from the file or interviews
regarding how an applicant was, or was not, assisted in
overcoming credit deficiencies or otherwise qualifying for
approval.
b. Complete Applicant Profiles
From the application files sample for each focal point,
complete applicant profiles for selected denied and
approved applications as follows:
• A principal goal is to identify cases where similarly
qualified prohibited basis and control group
applicants had different credit outcomes, because the
agencies have found that discrimination, including
differences in granting assistance during the approval
process, is more likely to occur with respect to
applicants who are not either clearly qualified or
unqualified ( i.e., “marginal” applicants). The
examiner-in-charge should, during the following
steps, judgmentally select from the initial sample
only those denied and approved applications which
constitute marginal transactions. (See Appendix on
Identifying Marginal Transactions for guidance)
• If few marginal control group applicants are identified
from the initial sample, review additional files of
approved control group applicants. This will either
increase the number of marginal approvals or confirm that
marginal approvals are so infrequent that the marginal
denials are unlikely to involve disparate treatment.
• The judgmental selection of both marginal-denied and
marginal-approved applicant loan files should be done
together, in a “back and forth” manner, to facilitate
close matches and a more consistent definition of
“marginal” between these two types of loan files.
• Once the marginal files have been identified, the data
elements called for on the profile spreadsheet are
extracted or noted and entered.
• While conducting the preceding step, the examiner
should simultaneously look for and document on the
spreadsheet any evidence found in marginal files
regarding the following:
° the extent of any assistance, including both
affirmative aid and waivers or partial waivers of
credit policy provisions or requirements, that
appears to have been provided to marginalapproved control group applicants which enabled
them to overcome one or more credit deficiencies,
such as excessive debt-to-income ratios; and
° the extent to which marginal-denied target group
applicants with similar deficiencies were, or were
not, provided similar affirmative aid, waivers or
other forms of assistance.
c. Review and Compare Profiles
• For each focal point, review all marginal profiles to determine
if the underwriter followed institution lending policies in
denying applications and whether the reason(s) for denial were
supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly
disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If any (a)
unexplained deviations from credit standards, (b) inaccurate
reasons for denial or (c) incorrect disclosures are noted,
(whether in a judgmental underwriting system, a scored
system or a mixed system) the examiner should obtain an
explanation from the underwriter and document the response
on an appropriate workpaper.
NOTE: In constructing the applicant profiles to be
compared, examiners must adjust the facts compared so that
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.15
assistance, waivers, or acts of discretion are treated
consistently between applicants. For example, if a control
group applicant’s DTI ratio was lowered to 42% because
the institution decided to include short-term overtime
income and a prohibited basis group applicant who was
denied due to “insufficient income” would have had his
ratio drop from 46% to 41% if his short-term overtime
income had been considered, then the examiners should
consider 41%, not 46%, in determining the benchmark.
• For each reason for denial identified within the target
group, rank the denied prohibited basis applicants,
beginning with the applicant whose qualification(s)
related to that reason for denial were least deficient.
(The top-ranked denied applicant in each such ranking
will be referred to below as the “benchmark”
applicant.)
• Compare each marginal control group approval to the
benchmark applicant in each reason-for-denial ranking
developed in step (b), above. If there are no approvals
who are equally or less qualified, then there are no
instances of disparate treatment for the institution to
account for. For all such approvals that appear no better
qualified than the denied benchmark applicant
o identify the approved loan on the worksheet or
spreadsheet as an “overlap approval,” and
o compare that overlap approval with other
marginal prohibited basis denials in the ranking to
determine whether additional overlaps exist. If
so, identify all overlapping approvals and denials
as above.
• Where the focal point involves use of a credit scoring
system, the analysis for disparate treatment is similar to
the procedures set forth in (c) above, and should focus
primarily on overrides of the scoring system itself. For
guidance on this type of analysis, refer to Considering
Automated Underwriting and Credit Scoring, Part C in
the Appendix.
",Explain the procedure that a reporting financial institution must follow when multiple financial institutions deny a covered credit application.,"The reporting financial institution must select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that were acted on during the three month period prior to the examination. It should include denied applications from businesses located in minority and/or integrated geographies or owned by women or minority group members. For each denied commercial application selected, specific information about the principal owners, purpose of the loan, and financial information about the commercial enterprise should be recorded. The institution should then select ten approved loans similar to the denied loans in terms of business type, purpose of loan, loan amount, terms, and collateral. Information parallel to that obtained for denied applications should be recorded for each approved commercial loan application. The credit criteria considered in the credit process for both approved and denied applications should be compared to established underwriting standards. Any deviations from credit standards and differences in loan terms granted for approved credit requests should be identified and documented. Instances where deviations were noted but not explained in the file should be discussed with the commercial credit underwriter and documented.","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
","Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.14 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Step 3. Compare Approved and Denied Applications
Overview: Although a creditor’s written policies and
procedures may appear to be nondiscriminatory, lending
personnel may interpret or apply policies in a
discriminatory manner. In order to detect any disparate
treatment among applicants, the examiner should first
eliminate all but “marginal transactions” (see 3.b. below)
from each selected focal point sample. Then, a detailed
profile of each marginal applicant’s qualifications, the
level of assistance received during the application process,
the reasons for denial, the loan terms, and other
information should be recorded on an Applicant Profile
Spreadsheet. Once profiled, the examiner can compare the
target and control groups for evidence that similarly
qualified applicants have been treated differently as to
either the institution’s credit decision or the quality of
assistance provided.
a. Create Applicant Profile Spreadsheet
Based upon the institution’s written and/or articulated
credit standards and loan policies, identify categories of
data that should be recorded for each applicant and
provide a field for each of these categories on a
worksheet or computerized spreadsheet. Certain data
(income, loan amount, debt, etc.) should always be
included in the spreadsheet, while the other data
selected will be tailored for each loan product and
institution based on applicable underwriting criteria
and such issues as branch location and underwriter.
Where credit bureau scores and/or application scores
are an element of the institution’s underwriting criteria
(or where such information is regularly recorded in
loan files, whether expressly used or not), include a
data field for this information in the spread sheet.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the quality of
assistance provided to target and control group applicants,
respectively, every work sheet should provide a
“comments” block appropriately labeled as the site for
recording observations from the file or interviews
regarding how an applicant was, or was not, assisted in
overcoming credit deficiencies or otherwise qualifying for
approval.
b. Complete Applicant Profiles
From the application files sample for each focal point,
complete applicant profiles for selected denied and
approved applications as follows:
• A principal goal is to identify cases where similarly
qualified prohibited basis and control group
applicants had different credit outcomes, because the
agencies have found that discrimination, including
differences in granting assistance during the approval

examiner-in-charge should, during the following
steps, judgmentally select from the initial sample
only those denied and approved applications which
constitute marginal transactions. (See Appendix on
Identifying Marginal Transactions for guidance)
• If few marginal control group applicants are identified
from the initial sample, review additional files of
approved control group applicants. This will either
increase the number of marginal approvals or confirm that
marginal approvals are so infrequent that the marginal
denials are unlikely to involve disparate treatment.
• The judgmental selection of both marginal-denied and
marginal-approved applicant loan files should be done
together, in a “back and forth” manner, to facilitate
close matches and a more consistent definition of
“marginal” between these two types of loan files.
• Once the marginal files have been identified, the data
elements called for on the profile spreadsheet are
extracted or noted and entered.
• While conducting the preceding step, the examiner
should simultaneously look for and document on the
spreadsheet any evidence found in marginal files
regarding the following:
° the extent of any assistance, including both
affirmative aid and waivers or partial waivers of
credit policy provisions or requirements, that
appears to have been provided to marginalapproved control group applicants which enabled
them to overcome one or more credit deficiencies,
such as excessive debt-to-income ratios; and
° the extent to which marginal-denied target group
applicants with similar deficiencies were, or were
not, provided similar affirmative aid, waivers or
other forms of assistance.
c. Review and Compare Profiles
• For each focal point, review all marginal profiles to determine
if the underwriter followed institution lending policies in
denying applications and whether the reason(s) for denial were
supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly
disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If any (a)
unexplained deviations from credit standards, (b) inaccurate
reasons for denial or (c) incorrect disclosures are noted,
(whether in a judgmental underwriting system, a scored
system or a mixed system) the examiner should obtain an
explanation from the underwriter and document the response
on an appropriate workpaper.
NOTE: In constructing the applicant profiles to be
compared, examiners must adjust the facts compared so that

assistance, waivers, or acts of discretion are treated
consistently between applicants. For example, if a control
group applicant’s DTI ratio was lowered to 42% because
the institution decided to include short-term overtime
income and a prohibited basis group applicant who was
denied due to “insufficient income” would have had his
ratio drop from 46% to 41% if his short-term overtime
income had been considered, then the examiners should
consider 41%, not 46%, in determining the benchmark.
• For each reason for denial identified within the target
group, rank the denied prohibited basis applicants,
beginning with the applicant whose qualification(s)
related to that reason for denial were least deficient.
(The top-ranked denied applicant in each such ranking
will be referred to below as the “benchmark”
applicant.)
• Compare each marginal control group approval to the
benchmark applicant in each reason-for-denial ranking
developed in step (b), above. If there are no approvals
who are equally or less qualified, then there are no
instances of disparate treatment for the institution to
account for. For all such approvals that appear no better
qualified than the denied benchmark applicant
o identify the approved loan on the worksheet or
spreadsheet as an “overlap approval,” and
o compare that overlap approval with other
marginal prohibited basis denials in the ranking to
determine whether additional overlaps exist. If
so, identify all overlapping approvals and denials
as above.
• Where the focal point involves use of a credit scoring
system, the analysis for disparate treatment is similar to
the procedures set forth in (c) above, and should focus
primarily on overrides of the scoring system itself. For
guidance on this type of analysis, refer to Considering

same time. See the sample data collection form in appendix E for sample language that a financial institution may use for
these notices.
5. Maintaining the record of an applicant's responses regarding principal owners' ethnicity, race, and sex separate from the
application. A financial institution must maintain the record of an applicant's response to the financial institution's inquiries
pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(19) separate from the application and accompanying information. See § 1002.111(b) and
comment 111(b)-1. If the financial institution provides a paper or electronic data collection form, the data collection form
must not be part of the application form or any other document that the financial institution uses to provide or collect any

in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under

Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:

Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”

legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.10 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.

different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants

3. Collecting information on behalf of creditors. Persons such as loan brokers and correspondents do not violate the

example, a loan to purchase a home).
i. If a creditor takes an application through an electronic medium that allows the creditor to see the applicant, the
creditor must treat the application as taken in person. The creditor must note the monitoring information on the basis
of visual observation or surname, if the applicant chooses not to provide the information.
ii. If an applicant applies through an electronic medium without video capability, the creditor treats the application as if it
were received by mail.
5. Applications through loan-shopping services. When a creditor receives an application through an unaffiliated loan-shopping
service, it does not have to request the monitoring information for purposes of the ECOA or subpart A of this Regulation B.
Creditors subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act should be aware, however, that data collection may be called for
under Regulation C (12 CFR part 1003), which generally requires creditors to report, among other things, the sex and race of
an applicant on brokered applications or applications received through a correspondent. Similarly, creditors that are covered
financial institutions under subpart B of this Regulation may also be required to collect, report, and maintain certain data, as
set forth in subpart B of this Regulation.
6. Inadvertent notation. If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information in a dwelling-related transaction not
covered by § 1002.13, the creditor may process and retain the application without violating the regulation.

Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these

credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

",correct,The answer correctly states that a creditor does not have to request monitoring information for purposes of the ECOA or Regulation B when the creditor is not required to report monitoring information under Regulation B. This aligns with the information provided in the reference text regarding when monitoring information is not required to be requested by the creditor.,
35,35,36,reg b,855b35528704bf38,In what ways can a creditor differentiate between different sources of earned income when assessing an applicant's creditworthiness?,"A creditor can differentiate between different sources of earned income when assessing an applicant's creditworthiness by scoring or treating earned income from a secondary source differently than earned income from a primary source. Additionally, a creditor may consider an applicant having more than one source of earned income, such as a full-time and a part-time job or two part-time jobs, and may evaluate each component of the applicant's income separately to determine reliability.","3. Consideration of income.
i. A creditor need not consider income at all in evaluating creditworthiness. If a creditor does consider income,
there are several acceptable methods, whether in a credit scoring or a judgmental system:
A. A creditor may score or take into account the total sum of all income stated by the applicant without
taking steps to evaluate the income for reliability.
B. A creditor may evaluate each component of the applicant's income, and then score or take into account
income determined to be reliable separately from other income; or the creditor may disregard that
portion of income that is not reliable when it aggregates reliable income.
C. A creditor that does not evaluate all income components for reliability must treat as reliable any
component of protected income that is not evaluated.

Paragraph 6(b)(6).
Paragraph 6(b)(7).
1. National origin—immigration status. The applicant's immigration status and ties to the community (such as employment and
continued residence in the area) could have a bearing on a creditor's ability to obtain repayment. Accordingly, the creditor may
consider immigration status and differentiate, for example, between a noncitizen who is a long-time resident with permanent resident
status and a noncitizen who is temporarily in this country on a student visa.
Paragraph 6(b)(8).
Section 1002.7—Rules Concerning Extensions of Credit
7(b) Designation of name.
ii. In considering the separate components of an applicant's income, the creditor may not automatically
discount or exclude from consideration any protected income. Any discounting or exclusion must be based
on the applicant's actual circumstances.
4. Part-time employment, sources of income. A creditor may score or take into account the fact that an applicant
has more than one source of earned income—a full-time and a part-time job or two part-time jobs. A creditor may
also score or treat earned income from a secondary source differently than earned income from a primary
source.

When considering income derived from a public assistance program, a creditor may take
into account, for example:
i. The length of time an applicant will likely remain eligible to receive such income.
ii. Whether the applicant will continue to qualify for benefits based on the status of the applicant's dependents (as in the
case of Temporary Aid to Needy Families, or social security payments to a minor).
iii. Whether the creditor can attach or garnish the income to assure payment of the debt in the event of default.
1. Consideration of an individual applicant. A creditor must evaluate income derived from part-time employment,
alimony, child support, separate maintenance payments, retirement benefits, or public assistance on an individual
basis, not on the basis of aggregate statistics; and must assess its reliability or unreliability by analyzing the
applicant's actual circumstances, not by analyzing statistical measures derived from a group.
2. Payments consistently made. In determining the likelihood of consistent payments of alimony, child support, or
separate maintenance, a creditor may consider factors such as whether payments are received pursuant to a
written agreement or court decree; the length of time that the payments have been received; whether the
payments are regularly received by the applicant; the availability of court or other procedures to compel payment;
and the creditworthiness of the payor, including the credit history of the payor when it is available to the creditor.
3. Consideration of income.
i. A creditor need not consider income at all in evaluating creditworthiness. If a creditor does consider income,
there are several acceptable methods, whether in a credit scoring or a judgmental system:
A. A creditor may score or take into account the total sum of all income stated by the applicant without
taking steps to evaluate the income for reliability.
B. A creditor may evaluate each component of the applicant's income, and then score or take into account
income determined to be reliable separately from other income; or the creditor may disregard that
portion of income that is not reliable when it aggregates reliable income.
C. A creditor that does not evaluate all income components for reliability must treat as reliable any
component of protected income that is not evaluated.",1,True,,In what ways can a creditor differentiate between different sources of earned income when assessing an applicant's creditworthiness?,"A creditor can differentiate between different sources of earned income when assessing an applicant's creditworthiness by considering factors such as stability, consistency, and predictability of the income source. Additionally, the creditor may evaluate the likelihood of continued income flow from each source, the nature of the work associated with the income, and any relevant documentation supporting the income sources.","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

Additionally, the creditor may evaluate the likelihood of continued income from each source, the nature of the work associated with the income, and any relevant documentation supporting the income sources.","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).

Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on

etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over

discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender

statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate

credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.

will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the

Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;

• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any

• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff

• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or

The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as

Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning

g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

might be appropriate.
2. The disclosure of self-testing results to an independent contractor acting as an auditor or consultant

The privilege is not lost if the creditor merely reveals or refers to the existence of the self-test.
1. Inadvertent errors. Inadvertent errors include, but are not limited to, clerical mistake, calculation error,

15(d)(1) Scope of privilege.
1. The privilege applies with respect to any examination, investigation or proceeding by Federal, State, or local government agencies
relating to compliance with the Act or this part. Accordingly, in a case brought under the ECOA, the privilege established under this
section preempts any inconsistent laws or court rules to the extent they might require disclosure of privileged self-testing data. The
privilege does not apply in other cases (such as in litigation filed solely under a State's fair lending statute). In such cases, if a court
orders a creditor to disclose self-test results, the disclosure is not a voluntary disclosure or waiver of the privilege for purposes of
paragraph 15(d)(2); a creditor may protect the information by seeking a protective order to limit availability and use of the self-testing
data and prevent dissemination beyond what is necessary in that case. Paragraph 15(d)(1) precludes a party who has obtained
privileged information from using it in a case brought under the ECOA, provided the creditor has not lost the privilege through
voluntary disclosure under paragraph 15(d)(2).

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","c. How and when the policy or communication was put
into effect.
d. How widely the policy or communication was applied.
e. Whether and to what extent applicants were adversely
affected by the policy or communication.
Step 2. Where any indicator of overt discrimination was an
oral statement or unwritten practice, determine and
document:
a. The precise nature of both the statement, or practice, and
of the fair lending concerns that they raise.
b. The identity of the persons making the statement or
applying the practice and their descriptions of the
reasons for it and the persons authorizing or directing the
use of the statement or practice.
",incorrect,"The answer correctly states that a creditor may be required to produce privileged documents for the purpose of determining a penalty or remedy after a violation of the ECOA or Regulation B has been formally adjudicated or admitted. The reference text specifically mentions this scenario in Paragraph 15(d)(3) of the provided regulations. However, the answer incorrectly adds the detail about the discovery phase of a legal proceeding, which is not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. The reference text does not specify that this production of privileged documents occurs only during the discovery phase.",
39,39,40,reg b,05cf4eb3a2e364f0,Explain with an example how an individual can indirectly own a percentage of a business through ownership of another company.,"An individual can indirectly own a percentage of a business through ownership of another company by considering a scenario where the applicant is company A. If company B owns a certain percentage of applicant company A, and an individual owns 100 percent of company B, then the individual indirectly owns the same percentage of applicant company A as company B owns. This means that the individual's ownership in company B translates to indirect ownership in company A based on the ownership structure.","4. Ownership. For purposes of determining if a business is a minority-owned business, an individual owns
a business if that individual directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding,
relationship or otherwise, has an equity interest in the business. Examples of ownership include being
the sole proprietor of a sole proprietorship, directly or indirectly owning or holding the stock of a
corporation or company, directly or indirectly having a partnership interest in a business, or directly or
indirectly having a membership interest in a limited liability company. Indirect as well as direct
ownership are used when determining ownership for purposes of §§ 1002.102(m) and 1002.107(a)
(18). Thus, where applicable, ownership must be traced through corporate or other indirect ownership
structures. For example, assume that the applicant is company A. If company B owns 60 percent of
applicant company A and an individual owns 100 percent of company B, the individual owns 60 percent
of applicant company A. Similarly, if an individual directly owns 20 percent of applicant company A and
is an equal partner in partnership B that owns the remaining 80 percent of applicant company A, the
individual owns 60 percent of applicant company A (i.e., 20 percent due through direct ownership and
40 percent indirectly through partnership B). A trustee is considered the owner of the trust. Thus, if a
trust owns a business and the trust has two co-trustees, each co-trustee owns 50 percent of the
business.
5. Control. An individual controls a business if that individual has significant responsibility to manage or
direct the business. An individual controls a business if the individual is an executive officer or senior
manager (e.g., a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, managing

member, general partner, president, vice president, or treasurer) or regularly performs similar functions.

A financial institution may assist an
applicant when the applicant is determining its LGBTQI+-owned business status but is not required to
do so. For purposes of reporting an applicant's status, a financial institution relies on the applicant's
determinations of its ownership, control, and accrual of net profits and losses.
4. Ownership. For purposes of determining if a business is an LGBTQI+-owned business, an individual
owns a business if that individual directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement,
understanding, relationship or otherwise, has an equity interest in the business. Examples of ownership
include being the sole proprietor of a sole proprietorship, directly or indirectly owning or holding the
stock of a corporation or company, directly or indirectly having a partnership interest in a business, or
directly or indirectly having a membership interest in a limited liability company. Indirect as well as
direct ownership are used when determining ownership for purposes of §§ 1002.102(l) and
1002.107(a)(18). Thus, where applicable, ownership must be traced through corporate or other indirect
ownership structures. For example, assume that the applicant is company A. If company B owns 60
percent of applicant company A and an individual owns 100 percent of company B, the individual owns
60 percent of applicant company A. Similarly, if an individual directly owns 20 percent of applicant
company A and is an equal partner in partnership B that owns the remaining 80 percent of applicant
company A, the individual owns 60 percent of applicant company A (i.e., 20 percent due through direct
ownership and 40 percent indirectly through partnership B). A trustee is considered the owner of the
trust. Thus, if a trust owns a business and the trust has two co-trustees, each co-trustee owns 50
percent of the business.
5. Control. An individual controls a business if that individual has significant responsibility to manage or
direct the business. An individual controls a business if the individual is an executive officer or senior
manager (e.g., a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, managing
member, general partner, president, vice president, or treasurer) or regularly performs similar functions.",1,True,,Explain with an example how an individual can indirectly own a percentage of a business through ownership of another company.,"An individual can indirectly own a percentage of a business through ownership of another company by holding shares in a holding company that, in turn, owns a portion of the target business. For example, if an individual owns shares in Company A, and Company A holds a significant stake in Company B, the individual indirectly owns a percentage of Company B through their ownership in Company A. This ownership structure allows individuals to have a stake in a business without directly owning shares in the target company.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

For example, if an individual owns shares in Company A, which is a holding company, and Company A owns 30% of Company B, then the individual indirectly owns 30% of Company B through their ownership in Company A. This ownership structure allows individuals to have ownership stakes in businesses without directly holding shares in the target company.","Examples of terms and features include

the institution; or referring a person who applies

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
",Explain with an example how an individual can indirectly own a percentage of a business through ownership of another company.,"An individual can indirectly own a percentage of a business through ownership of another company by holding shares in a holding company that, in turn, owns a portion of the target business. For example, if an individual owns shares in Company A, which is a holding company, and Company A holds a significant stake in Company B, then the individual indirectly owns a percentage of Company B through their ownership in Company A. This ownership structure allows individuals to have ownership interests in businesses without directly holding shares in the target company.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any

g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such

to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
","What steps must a financial institution take if it initially determines that an applicant is not a small business, but later concludes that the applicant is indeed a small business before taking final action on the application?","The financial institution must ensure that the examination procedures are generally focused on small business credit, which includes commercial applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in the preceding fiscal year. If it is later determined that the applicant is indeed a small business, the institution should proceed with the examination procedures specific to small business credit as outlined in the guidelines.","Step 7.

(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
","What steps must a financial institution take if it initially determines that an applicant is not a small business, but later concludes that the applicant is indeed a small business before taking final action on the application?","The financial institution must ensure that the examination procedures are generally focused on small business credit, particularly for commercial applicants with gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in the preceding fiscal year. This focus should be maintained unless there is evidence suggesting that a focus on other commercial products would be more appropriate.","Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a

also any geographical terms used by the institution that

spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.

","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.

c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the

However, based on the reference text provided, the definition of 'credit card' is clearly outlined in section (k) which describes it as any card, plate, coupon book, or other single credit device that may be used to obtain money, property, or services on credit. Therefore, the answer is incorrect as the definition of 'credit card' is indeed provided in the document.",
42,42,43,reg b,fb92402063fc8c4d,What constitutes a covered application when a borrower requests to change terms of an existing account?,An applicant's request to change one or more terms of an existing account does not constitute a covered application unless the applicant is requesting additional credit amounts on the account.,"2. Reevaluation, extension, or renewal requests that do not request additional credit amounts. An
applicant's request to change one or more terms of an existing account does not constitute a covered
application, unless the applicant is requesting additional credit amounts on the account. For example,
an applicant's request to extend the duration on a line of credit or to remove a guarantor would not be a
covered application. However, assuming other requirements of a covered application are met, an
applicant's request to refinance would be reportable. A refinancing occurs when an existing obligation
is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower.
3. Reevaluation, extension, or renewal requests that request additional credit amounts. A Assuming other
requirements of a covered application are met, an applicant's request for additional credit amounts on
an existing account constitutes a covered application. For example, an applicant's request for a line
increase on an existing line of credit, made in accordance with a financial institution's procedures for
the type of credit requested, would be a covered application. As discussed in comment 107(a)(7)-4,
when reporting a covered application that seeks additional credit amounts on an existing account, the
financial institution need only report the additional credit amount sought, and not the entire credit
amount. For example, if an applicant currently has a line of credit account for $100,000, and seeks to
increase the line to $150,000, the financial institution reports the amount applied for as $50,000.
4. Reviews or evaluations initiated by the financial institution. For purposes of subpart B of this part, the
term covered application does not include evaluations or reviews of existing accounts initiated by the
financial institution because the business has not made a request for credit.

For example, if three businesses jointly apply as
co-applicants for a term loan to purchase a piece of equipment, but only one of the businesses is a
small business, as defined in § 1002.106(b), the financial institution reports on the single small
business. If, however, two of the businesses are small businesses, as defined in § 1002.106(b), the
financial institution must have a procedure for designating which small business among multiple small
business co-applicants it will report information on, such as consistently reporting on the first small
business listed on an application form. See also § 1002.5(a)(4)(x), which permits a creditor to collect
certain protected information about co-applicants under certain circumstances.
11. Refinancings and evaluation, extension, or renewal requests that request additional credit amounts. As
discussed in comments 103(b)-2 and -3, assuming other requirements of a covered application are
met, an applicant's request to refinance and an applicant's request for additional credit amounts on an
existing account both constitute covered applications.
1. In general. The circumstances set forth in § 1002.103(b) are not covered applications for purposes of
subpart B of this part, even if considered applications under subpart A of this part. However, in no way
are the exclusions in § 1002.103(b) intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, change, or interfere with
the scope of the term application in § 1002.2(f) as applicable to subpart A.
2. Reevaluation, extension, or renewal requests that do not request additional credit amounts. An
applicant's request to change one or more terms of an existing account does not constitute a covered
application, unless the applicant is requesting additional credit amounts on the account. For example,
an applicant's request to extend the duration on a line of credit or to remove a guarantor would not be a
covered application. However, assuming other requirements of a covered application are met, an
applicant's request to refinance would be reportable. A refinancing occurs when an existing obligation
is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower.
3. Reevaluation, extension, or renewal requests that request additional credit amounts.",1,True,,What constitutes a covered application when a borrower requests to change terms of an existing account?,"A covered application is considered to exist when a borrower requests to change the terms of an existing account if the request is for a new extension of credit that is subject to Regulation B. This includes situations where the borrower is seeking to modify an existing account, such as increasing the credit limit or changing the repayment terms, and the creditor evaluates the request based on the borrower's qualifications.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.

underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored

borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the

that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
",What constitutes a covered application when a borrower requests to change terms of an existing account?,A covered application is considered to be made when a borrower requests to change the terms of an existing account.,"This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant

business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
",What constitutes a covered application when a borrower requests to change terms of an existing account?,"When a borrower requests to change terms of an existing account, it would constitute a covered application if the request is for a new extension of credit that is subject to a creditor's review and approval process. This would typically involve a formal application process where the borrower's financial information is assessed to determine if the requested changes can be approved.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.

43,43,44,reg b,052fb9805c3afb10,What is the significance of the compliance date specified in § 1002.114(b) for covered financial institutions?,"The compliance date specified in § 1002.114(b) determines when covered financial institutions must begin compiling data, comply with firewall requirements, and maintain records as per the regulations. It also sets the deadline for these institutions to comply with specific sections of the regulations by a certain date.","The financial institution must compile data for this period pursuant to § 1002.107, comply with
the firewall requirements of § 1002.108, and maintain records as specified in § 1002.111. In addition, for data
collected during this period, the covered financial institution must comply with §§ 1002.109 and 1002.110(c) and (d)
by June 1, 2026.
3. Informal names for compliance date provisions. To facilitate discussion of the compliance dates specified in § 1002.114(b)
(1), (2), and (3), in the official commentary and any other documents referring to these compliance dates, the Bureau adopts
the following informal simplified names. Tier 1 refers to the cohort of covered financial institutions that have a compliance
date of October 1, 2024 pursuant to § 1002.114(b)(1). Tier 2 refers to the cohort of covered financial institutions that have a
compliance date of April 1, 2025 pursuant to § 1002.114(b)(2). Tier 3 refers to the cohort of covered financial institutions
that have a compliance date of January 1, 2026 pursuant to § 1002.114(b)(3).
4. Examples. The following scenarios illustrate how to determine whether a financial institution is a covered financial
institution and which compliance date specified in § 1002.114(b) applies.
i. Financial Institution A originated 3,000 covered credit transactions for small businesses in calendar year 2022, and
3,000 in calendar year 2023. Financial Institution A is in Tier 1 and has a compliance date of October 1, 2024.
ii. Financial Institution B originated 2,000 covered credit transactions for small businesses in calendar year 2022, and
3,000 in calendar year 2023. Because Financial Institution B did not originate at least 2,500 covered credit transactions
for small businesses in each of 2022 and 2023, it is not in Tier 1. Because Financial Institution B did originate at least
500 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of 2022 and 2023, it is in Tier 2 and has a compliance
date of April 1, 2025.
iii.

Thus, Financial Institution A may have had a reasonable basis to believe, at the time it
collected data under § 1002.107(a)(18) and (19), that the applicant was a small business pursuant to § 1002.106, in which
case Financial Institution A's collection of such data would not violate the Act or this regulation.
1. Application of compliance date. The applicable compliance date in § 1002.114(b) is the date by which the covered financial
institution must begin to compile data as specified in § 1002.107, comply with the firewall requirements of § 1002.108, and
begin to maintain records as specified in § 1002.111. In addition, the covered financial institution must comply with §
1002.110(c) and (d) no later than June 1 of the year after the applicable compliance date. For instance, if § 1002.114(b)(2)
applies to a financial institution, it must comply with §§ 1002.107 and 1002.108, and portions of § 1002.111, beginning
April 1, 2025, and it must comply with § 1002.110(c) and (d), and portions of § 1002.111, no later than June 1, 2026.
2. Initial partial year collections pursuant to § 1002.114(b).
i. When the compliance date of October 1, 2024 specified in § 1002.114(b)(1) applies to a covered financial institution,
the financial institution is required to collect data for covered applications during the period from October 1, 2024 to
December 31, 2024. The financial institution must compile data for this period pursuant to § 1002.107, comply with
the firewall requirements of § 1002.108, and maintain records as specified in § 1002.111. In addition, for data

understand the organization, staffing, training,
recordkeeping, auditing, policies and procedures of the
institution’s fair lending compliance systems. Review
these systems and note the following risk factors:
C1. ",correct,"The compliance date specified in § 1002.114(b) for covered financial institutions is significant because it marks the deadline by which these institutions must comply with specific requirements such as compiling data, complying with firewall requirements, and maintaining records as specified in the regulation. Additionally, it outlines the timeline for compliance with other sections like §§ 1002.109, 1002.110(c) and (d).

General. Section 1002.107(a) describes a covered financial institution's obligation to compile and maintain data
regarding the covered applications it receives from small businesses.
i. A covered financial institution reports these data even if the credit originated pursuant to the reported
application was subsequently sold by the institution.
ii. A covered financial institution annually reports data for covered applications for which final action was taken
in the previous calendar year.
iii. A covered financial institution reports data for a covered application on its small business lending
application register for the calendar year during which final action was taken on the application, even if the
institution received the application in a previous calendar year.
2. Free-form text fields. A covered financial institution may use technology such as autocorrect and predictive text
when requesting applicant-provided data under subpart B of this part that the financial institution reports via free-
form text fields, provided that such technology does not restrict the applicant's ability to write in its own response
instead of using text suggested by the technology.

included in the Filing Instructions Guide, which is available at https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-
research/small-business-lending/filing-instructions-guide/.
4. Additional data point response options. The Bureau may add additional response options to the lists of responses
contained in the commentary that follows for certain of the data points set forth in § 1002.107(a), via the Filing
Instructions Guide. Refer to the Filing Instructions Guide for any updates for each reporting year.
1. Unique within the financial institution. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(1) by compiling and
reporting an alphanumeric application or loan identifier unique within the financial institution to the specific
application. The identifier must not exceed 45 characters, and must begin with the financial institution's Legal
Entity Identifier (LEI), as defined in comment 109(b)(6)-1. Separate applications for the same applicant must have
separate identifiers. The identifier may only include standard numerical and/or upper-case alphabetical
characters and cannot include dashes, other special characters, or characters with diacritics. The financial
institution may assign the unique identifier at any time prior to reporting the application.

(9) The type of financial institution that it is, indicated by selecting the appropriate type or types of institution from the list
provided.
(10) Whether the financial institution is voluntarily reporting covered applications from small businesses.
(c) Procedures for the submission of data to the Bureau. The Bureau shall make available a Filing Instructions Guide, containing
technical instructions for the submission of data to the Bureau pursuant to this section, as well as any related materials, at
https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/small-business-lending/filing-instructions-guide/.
(a) Publication of small business lending application registers and associated financial institution information. The Bureau shall
make available to the public generally the data reported to it by financial institutions pursuant to § 1002.109, subject to
deletions or modifications made by the Bureau if the Bureau determines that the deletion or modification of the data would
advance a privacy interest. The Bureau shall make such data available on an annual basis.
(b) Publication of aggregate data. The Bureau may compile and aggregate data submitted by financial institutions pursuant to §
1002.109, and make any compilations or aggregations of such data publicly available as the Bureau deems appropriate.
(c) Statement of financial institution's small business lending data available on the Bureau's website. A covered financial
institution shall make available to the public on its website, or otherwise upon request, a statement that the covered
financial institution's small business lending application register, as modified by the Bureau pursuant to § 1002.110(a), is or
will be available from the Bureau. A financial institution shall use language provided by the Bureau, or substantially similar
language, to satisfy the requirement to provide a statement pursuant to this paragraph (c).

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

in Part III, G.
• Where any of the risk factors M1-M7 are present,
consider conducting a marketing analysis as described in
Part III, H.
• Where an institution uses age in any credit scoring system,
consider conducting an examination analysis of that credit
scoring system’s compliance with the requirements of
Regulation B as described in Part III, I.
Step Six: Identify Consumer Lending Discrimination Risk
Factors
For any consumer loan products selected in Step One for risk
analysis, examiners should conduct a risk factor review similar
to that conducted for residential lending products in Steps
Three through Five, above. Examiners should consult with
agency supervisory staff regarding the potential use of
surrogates to identify possible prohibited basis group
individuals.
","Additionally, consideration should be limited
to factors which examiners determine to be legitimate.
While the period for review should be 12-months, prohibited
basis group and control group borrowers should be grouped
and reviewed around a range of dates during which the
institution’s practices for the term or condition being
reviewed were the same. Generally, examiners should use
the loan origination date or the loan application date.
Identify data to be analyzed for each focal point to be
reviewed and record this information for each borrower on
a spreadsheet to ensure a valid comparison regarding terms
and conditions. For example, in certain cases, an institution
may offer slightly differentiated products with significant
pricing implications to borrowers.

However, the reference text clearly states that the submission deadline is on or before June 1 following the calendar year for which data are compiled. Therefore, the answer is incorrect as it provides the wrong deadline for submission based on the reference text.",

The size of the random sample, set out
in column B, shall depend on the size of the financial institution's small business lending application register, as shown in
column A of the table in appendix F. A financial institution has not maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid
errors if either there is a reasonable basis to believe the error was intentional or there is evidence that the financial
institution has not maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid errors.
2. Tolerances and data fields. For purposes of determining whether an error is bona fide under § 1002.112(b), the term “data
field” generally refers to individual fields. All required data fields, and valid response options for those fields, are set forth in
the Bureau's Filing Instructions Guide, available at https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/small-business-
lending/filing-instructions-guide/. Some data fields may allow for more than one response. For example, with respect to
information on the ethnicity and race of an applicant's principal owner, a data field may identify more than one race or
ethnicity. If there are one or more errors within an ethnicity data field, or within a race data field, for a particular principal
owner, they would count as one (and only one) error for that data field. For instance, in the ethnicity data field, if an applicant

indicates that one of its principal owners is Cuban, but the financial institution reports that the principal owner is Mexican
and Puerto Rican, the financial institution has made one error in the ethnicity data field for that principal owner. For
purposes of the error threshold table in appendix F, the financial institution is deemed to have made one error, not two.
3. Tolerances and safe harbors.

Even when the number of errors in a particular data field do not equal or exceed the threshold in column C, if either there is a
reasonable basis to believe that errors in that field were intentional or there is evidence that the financial institution did not maintain
procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors, then the errors are not bona fide errors under § 1002.112(b).
For purposes of determining bona fide errors under § 1002.112(b), the term “data field” generally refers to individual fields. Some data
fields may allow for more than one response. For example, with respect to information on the ethnicity or race of an applicant's
principal owners, a data field may identify more than one race or more than one ethnicity for a given person. If one or more of the
ethnicities or races identified in a data field are erroneous, they count as one (and only one) error for that data field.

Part I — Examination Scope Guidelines Background
Consistent with the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council Interagency Fair Lending Examination
Procedures, FDIC examiners evaluate fair lending risk
during the scoping process by completing three general
steps:
1. Examiners develop an institutional overview to assess an
institution’s inherent fair lending risk. As part of this
process, examiners become familiar with an institution’s
structure and management, supervisory history, loan
portfolio, and credit and market operations. Once examiners
understand a financial institution’s lending operations they
can identify the level of inherent risk. Inherent risk for fair
lending is broad-based and would impact a range of products
if no controls or other mitigating factors were in place to
control the risk. Inherent risk arises from the general 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.4 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
conditions or the environment in which the institution
operates. The risk could be present based on an institution’s
structure, supervisory history, the composition of the loan
portfolio, and the credit and market operations
2. If an examiner believes that an institution has more than
minimal inherent fair lending risk, the examiner should then
identify the product(s) or product group(s) to review. The
products or product groups selected may differ based on the
type of discrimination. For example, for purposes of pricing,
an examiner may select HMDA loans for further review,
while for underwriting, the examiner may select consumer
loans. Examiners are not expected to review all products for
discrimination risk if there is more than minimal inherent
risk. Rather, examiners should use their judgment and
consider the following when deciding which loan products
warrant further review. Examiners would then identify any
discrimination risk factors and assess an institution’s
compliance management system (CMS) for fair lending.
Understanding the strength of an institution’s CMS is
necessary to properly assess whether an institution has
sufficiently mitigated applicable discrimination risk factors.
If there is minimal inherent risk, no additional analysis is
necessary and the fair lending review can conclude.
3. For those discrimination risk factors that have not been
fully mitigated, examiners compile a list of potential focal
points and identify which should be pursued as a focal point.
The FDIC has developed the Fair Lending Scope and
Conclusions Memorandum (FLSC) to implement a standard
nationwide format for documenting the scope and
conclusions of fair lending reviews. FLSC has been adopted
as a means of focusing the examiner’s attention to the areas
that pose the greatest unmanaged fair lending risk to the
institution. It incorporates the Interagency Fair Lending
Examination Procedures1 and assists in documenting the
types of fair lending risks that are present; the controls that
management has put in place to manage the risk; the
effectiveness of these controls; why the particular focal
point(s) are chosen; the level of review conducted; and the
results of any additional analysis that was conducted. The
FLSC is included in section IV-3.1 of this manual.
The scope of an examination encompasses the loan
product(s), market(s), decision center(s), time frame, and
prohibited basis and control group(s) to be analyzed during
the examination. These procedures refer to each potential
combination of those elements as a “focal point.” Setting the
scope of an examination involves, first, identifying all of the
potential focal points that appear worthwhile to examine.
Then, from among those, examiners select the Focal
Point(s) that will form the scope of the examination, based
on risk factors, priorities established in these procedures or

III of this section of the manual.
by their respective agencies, the record from past
examinations, and other relevant guidance. This phase
includes obtaining an overview of an institution’s
compliance management system as it relates to fair lending.
When selecting focal points for review, examiners may
determine that the institution has performed “self-tests” or
“self-evaluations” related to specific lending products. The
difference between “self-tests” and “self-evaluations” is
discussed in the Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations to
Streamline the Examination section of the Appendix.
Institutions must share all information regarding “selfevaluations” and certain limited information related to “selftests.” Institutions may choose to voluntarily disclose
additional information about “self-tests.” Examiners should
make sure that institutions understand that voluntarily
sharing the results of self-tests will result in a loss of
confidential status of these tests. Information from “selfevaluations” or “self-tests” may allow the scoping to be
streamlined. ","intended to ensure the
validity of the review. For example, where an institution’s
LAR data is relied upon, examiners should generally
validate the accuracy of the institution’s submitted data by
selecting a sample of LAR entries and verifying that the
information noted on the LAR was reported according to
instructions by comparing information contained in the loan
file for each sampled loan. If the LAR data are inconsistent
with the information contained in the loan files, depending
on the nature of the errors, examiners may not be able to
proceed with a fair lending analysis until the LAR data
have been corrected by the institution. In cases where
inaccuracies impede the examination, examiners should
direct the institution to take action to ensure data integrity
(data scrubbing, monitoring, training, etc.).
NOTE: While the procedures refer to the use of HMDA data,
other data sources should be considered, especially in the
case of non-HMDA reporters or institutions that originate
loans but are not required to report them on a LAR.
B. Documenting Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment
Where the scoping process or any other source identifies
overt evidence of disparate treatment, the examiner should
assess the nature of the policy or statement and the extent of
its impact on affected applicants by conducting the
following analysis.

Step 1. Where the indicator(s) of overt discrimination are
found in or based on a written policy (for example, a credit

a. The precise language of the apparently discriminatory
policy or communication and the nature of the fair

b. The institution’s stated purpose in adopting the policy
or communication and the identity of the person on
whose authority it was issued or adopted.

necessary and the fair lending review can conclude.
3. For those discrimination risk factors that have not been
fully mitigated, examiners compile a list of potential focal
points and identify which should be pursued as a focal point.
The FDIC has developed the Fair Lending Scope and
Conclusions Memorandum (FLSC) to implement a standard
nationwide format for documenting the scope and
conclusions of fair lending reviews. FLSC has been adopted
as a means of focusing the examiner’s attention to the areas
that pose the greatest unmanaged fair lending risk to the
institution. It incorporates the Interagency Fair Lending
Examination Procedures1 and assists in documenting the
types of fair lending risks that are present; the controls that
management has put in place to manage the risk; the
effectiveness of these controls; why the particular focal
point(s) are chosen; the level of review conducted; and the
results of any additional analysis that was conducted. The
FLSC is included in section IV-3.1 of this manual.
The scope of an examination encompasses the loan
product(s), market(s), decision center(s), time frame, and
prohibited basis and control group(s) to be analyzed during
the examination. These procedures refer to each potential
combination of those elements as a “focal point.” Setting the
scope of an examination involves, first, identifying all of the
potential focal points that appear worthwhile to examine.
Then, from among those, examiners select the Focal
Point(s) that will form the scope of the examination, based
on risk factors, priorities established in these procedures or
 1 The interagency examination procedures are presented in their entirety in Part
III of this section of the manual.
by their respective agencies, the record from past
examinations, and other relevant guidance. This phase
includes obtaining an overview of an institution’s
compliance management system as it relates to fair lending.
When selecting focal points for review, examiners may
determine that the institution has performed “self-tests” or
“self-evaluations” related to specific lending products. The
difference between “self-tests” and “self-evaluations” is
discussed in the Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations to
Streamline the Examination section of the Appendix.
Institutions must share all information regarding “selfevaluations” and certain limited information related to “selftests.” Institutions may choose to voluntarily disclose
additional information about “self-tests.” Examiners should
make sure that institutions understand that voluntarily
sharing the results of self-tests will result in a loss of
confidential status of these tests. Information from “selfevaluations” or “self-tests” may allow the scoping to be
streamlined. ","intended to ensure the
validity of the review. For example, where an institution’s
LAR data is relied upon, examiners should generally
validate the accuracy of the institution’s submitted data by
selecting a sample of LAR entries and verifying that the
information noted on the LAR was reported according to
instructions by comparing information contained in the loan
file for each sampled loan. If the LAR data are inconsistent
with the information contained in the loan files, depending
on the nature of the errors, examiners may not be able to
proceed with a fair lending analysis until the LAR data
have been corrected by the institution. In cases where
inaccuracies impede the examination, examiners should
direct the institution to take action to ensure data integrity
(data scrubbing, monitoring, training, etc.).
NOTE: While the procedures refer to the use of HMDA data,
other data sources should be considered, especially in the
case of non-HMDA reporters or institutions that originate
loans but are not required to report them on a LAR.
B. Documenting Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment
Where the scoping process or any other source identifies
overt evidence of disparate treatment, the examiner should
assess the nature of the policy or statement and the extent of
its impact on affected applicants by conducting the
following analysis.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.13
Step 1. Where the indicator(s) of overt discrimination are
found in or based on a written policy (for example, a credit
scorecard) or communication, determine and document:
a. The precise language of the apparently discriminatory
policy or communication and the nature of the fair
lending concerns that it raises.
b. The institution’s stated purpose in adopting the policy
or communication and the identity of the person on
whose authority it was issued or adopted.
",incorrect,"The answer provided incorrectly states that the threshold specified by the Bureau for a financial institution to be presumed to have maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid errors in a given data field is when the institution's error rate in that field is less than or equal to 2 percent. However, based on the reference text, the actual threshold specified by the Bureau is not based on a specific error rate percentage but rather on the number of errors in a data field and the circumstances surrounding those errors. The reference text mentions thresholds in column C of the table in appendix F, which are not related to a specific error rate percentage but rather depend on the size of the financial institution's small business lending application register and the number of errors in a data field.",
47,47,48,reg b,8567fd0f3ca2dc7a,"What are the limitations placed on creditors regarding the designation of names for opening or maintaining accounts, as outlined in the document?","Creditors may require joint applicants on an account to designate a single name for administering the account and embossing on credit cards, but they cannot mandate that the name be the husband's name. Additionally, when spouses are jointly liable on an account, a creditor can terminate the account if one or both spouses repudiate responsibility for future charges, request separate accounts, or ask for the joint account to be closed.","2. Open-end credit—choice of authorized user. A creditor that permits an account holder to designate an authorized
user may not restrict this designation on a prohibited basis. For example, if the creditor allows the designation of
spouses as authorized users, the creditor may not refuse to accept a non-spouse as an authorized user.
3. Overdraft authority on transaction accounts. If a transaction account (such as a checking account or NOW
account) includes an overdraft line of credit, the creditor may require that all persons authorized to draw on the
transaction account assume liability for any overdraft.
1. Single name on account. A creditor may require that joint applicants on an account designate a single name for
purposes of administering the account and that a single name be embossed on any credit cards issued on the
account. But the creditor may not require that the name be the husband's name. (See § 1002.10 for rules

governing the furnishing of credit history on accounts held by spouses.)
1. Termination coincidental with marital status change. When an account holder's marital status changes, a creditor generally
may not terminate the account unless it has evidence that the account holder is now unable or unwilling to repay. But the
creditor may terminate an account on which both spouses are jointly liable, even if the action coincides with a change in
marital status, when one or both spouses:
i. Repudiate responsibility for future charges on the joint account.
ii. Request separate accounts in their own names.
iii. Request that the joint account be closed.
2. Updating information. A creditor may periodically request updated information from applicants but may not use events
related to a prohibited basis—such as an applicant's retirement or reaching a particular age, or a change in name or marital
status—to trigger such a request.

Section 1002.10—Furnishing of Credit Information
10(a) Designation of accounts.
Section 1002.11—Relation to State Law
11(a) Inconsistent state laws.
Section 1002.12—Record Retention
12(a) Retention of prohibited information.
1. Scope. The requirements of § 1002.10 for designating and reporting credit information apply only to consumer credit
transactions. Moreover, they apply only to creditors that opt to furnish credit information to credit bureaus or to other
creditors; there is no requirement that a creditor furnish credit information on its accounts.
2. Reporting on all accounts. The requirements of § 1002.10 apply only to accounts held or used by spouses. However, a
creditor has the option to designate all joint accounts (or all accounts with an authorized user) to reflect the participation of
both parties, whether or not the accounts are held by persons married to each other.
3. Designating accounts. In designating accounts and reporting credit information, a creditor need not distinguish between
accounts on which the spouse is an authorized user and accounts on which the spouse is a contractually liable party.
4. File and index systems. The regulation does not require the creation or maintenance of separate files in the name of each
participant on a joint or user account, or require any other particular system of recordkeeping or indexing. It requires only
that a creditor be able to report information in the name of each spouse on accounts covered by § 1002.10. Thus, if a
creditor receives a credit inquiry about the wife, it should be able to locate her credit file without asking the husband's name.
1. New parties. When new parties who are spouses undertake a legal obligation on an account, as in the case of a mortgage
loan assumption, the creditor must change the designation on the account to reflect the new parties and must furnish
subsequent credit information on the account in the new names.
2. Request to change designation of account.",1,True,,"What are the limitations placed on creditors regarding the designation of names for opening or maintaining accounts, as outlined in the document?",Creditors are required to avoid using names or codes that indicate the prohibited basis characteristics of applicants when opening or maintaining accounts.,"U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/

processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.

applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the

to the violation expired before the creditor obtained the results of the self-test or the applicant is otherwise
ineligible for such relief.
(4) No admission of violation. Taking corrective action is not an admission that a violation occurred.
(d) Scope of privilege —
(1) General rule. The report or results of a privileged self-test may not be obtained or used:
(i) By a government agency in any examination or investigation relating to compliance with the Act or this part; or
(ii) By a government agency or an applicant (including a prospective applicant who alleges a violation of § 1002.4(b))
in any proceeding or civil action in which a violation of the Act or this part is alleged.
(2) Loss of privilege. The report or results of a self-test are not privileged under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the
creditor or a person with lawful access to the report or results:
(i) Voluntarily discloses any part of the report or results, or any other information privileged under this section, to an
applicant or government agency or to the public;

charges that the creditor has violated the Act or regulation; or
(iii) Fails or is unable to produce written or recorded information about the self-test that is required to be retained
under § 1002.12(b)(6) when the information is needed to determine whether the privilege applies. This paragraph
does not limit any other penalty or remedy that may be available for a violation of § 1002.12.
(3) Limited use of privileged information. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the self-test report or results
and any other information privileged under this section may be obtained and used by an applicant or government
agency solely to determine a penalty or remedy after a violation of the Act or this part has been adjudicated or
admitted. Disclosures for this limited purpose may be used only for the particular proceeding in which the adjudication
or admission was made. Information disclosed under this paragraph (d)(3) remains privileged under paragraph (d)(1)

49,49,50,reg b,eefa01af26988cf9,How does the concept of agents come into play when reporting covered applications in the context of financial institutions?,"When a covered financial institution takes action on a covered application through its agent, the financial institution reports the application. For instance, if Financial Institution A's agent, Financial Institution B, approves an application before closing and a covered credit transaction is originated, Financial Institution A reports the covered credit transaction as an origination. The determination of whether one party is the agent of another is based on state law.","Financial Institution A received a covered application and forwarded it to Financial Institutions B, C, and D. Financial
Institution A was not acting as anyone's agent. Financial Institution B and C reviewed the application and made a
credit decision approving the application and Financial Institution D reviewed the application and made a credit
decision denying the application. Prior to closing, Financial Institution A makes a credit decision on the application by
deciding to offer to the applicant the credit terms offered by Financial Institution B and does not convey to the
applicant the credit terms offered by Financial Institution C. The applicant does not accept the covered credit
transaction. As the last financial institution with the authority for setting the material terms of the covered credit
transaction, Financial Institution A reports the application as approved but not accepted. Financial Institutions B, C,
and D do not report the application because they were not the last financial institution with the authority for setting the
material terms of the covered credit transaction. Assume the same facts, except the applicant accepts the terms of
the covered credit transaction from Financial Institution B as offered by Financial Institution A. The covered credit
transaction closes in Financial Institution A's name. Financial Institution B purchases the transaction after closing.
Here, Financial Institution A reports the application as originated. Financial Institutions B, C, and D do not report the
application because they were not the last financial institution responsible for setting the material terms of the

1. Changes to financial institution identifying information. If a financial institution's information required pursuant to §
1002.109(b) changes, the financial institution shall provide the new information with the data submission for the collection
year of the change. For example, assume two financial institutions that previously reported data under subpart B of this part
merge and the surviving institution retained its Legal Entity Identifier but obtained a new TIN in February 2026. The surviving
institution must report the new TIN with its data submission for its 2026 data (which is due by June 1, 2027) pursuant to §
1002.109(b)(5). Likewise, if that financial institution's Federal prudential regulator changes in February 2026 as a result of

It is important to understand how responsibility is allocated among these third parties and the institution, as well as the institution's familiarity with the actions of these agents. The institution may be in violation if it participates in transactions where it knew or reasonably should have known that other parties were discriminating. Therefore, evaluating the actions of these agents and ensuring fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms, conditions, redlining, and steering is crucial when reporting covered applications in the context of financial institutions.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
",How does the concept of agents come into play when reporting covered applications in the context of financial institutions?,"The concept of agents comes into play when reporting covered applications in the context of financial institutions by considering any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, involved in the credit decision process. It is important to understand how responsibility is allocated among these third parties and the institution, as well as the institution's familiarity with the actions of these third parties. The institution may be in violation if it participates in transactions where it knew or reasonably should have known that other parties were discriminating. Understanding the interactions and relationships with these third parties is crucial for evaluating fair lending compliance in the lending operations of a financial institution.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review

with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer

the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

",How does the concept of agents come into play when reporting covered applications in the context of financial institutions?,"The concept of agents comes into play when reporting covered applications in the context of financial institutions by considering any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, involved in the credit decision process. It is important to understand how responsibility is allocated among these third parties and the institution. The institution's familiarity with the actions of these third parties is crucial, as the institution may be in violation if it participates in transactions where it knew or should have known that other parties were discriminating. Understanding the dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and non-affiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third-party lenders is essential to evaluate their impact on the lending operations of the institution.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
",correct,"The answer provided explains the concept of agents in the context of reporting covered applications in financial institutions. It discusses the involvement of third parties, responsibility allocation, fair lending compliance, and the importance of evaluating actions of agents. It also highlights the risks of participating in discriminatory transactions. The reference text provides specific scenarios and guidelines related to agents in reporting covered applications. Therefore, the answer is comprehensive and addresses the key points related to the question.",
50,50,51,reg b,b9e8591eb429a21d,Describe the safe harbor provision for reporting application dates on a small business lending application register.,The safe harbor provision for reporting application dates on a small business lending application register allows a financial institution to report an application date that is within three business days of the actual application date without violating the Act or the relevant subpart. This provision is in accordance with § 1002.112(c)(1) and applies to applications initially submitted to a third party as described in § 1002.107(a)(2).,"(c) Limitation on personally identifiable information in certain records retained under this section. In reporting a small business
lending application register pursuant to § 1002.109, maintaining the register pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and
maintaining a separate record of information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, a financial institution shall not
include any name, specific address, telephone number, email address, or any other personally identifiable information
concerning any individual who is, or is connected with, an applicant, other than as required pursuant to § 1002.107 or
paragraph (b) of this section.
(a) Administrative enforcement and civil liability. A violation of section 704B of the Act or this subpart is subject to
administrative sanctions and civil liability as provided in sections 704 (15 U.S.C. 1691c) and 706 (15 U.S.C. 1691e) of the
Act, where applicable.
(b) Bona fide errors. A bona fide error in compiling, maintaining, or reporting data with respect to a covered application is one
that was unintentional and occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such an error. A
bona fide error is not a violation of the Act or this subpart. A financial institution is presumed to maintain procedures
reasonably adapted to avoid such errors with respect to a given data field if the number of errors found in a random sample
of the financial institution's submission for the data field does not equal or exceed a threshold specified by the Bureau for
this purpose in appendix F to this part. However, an error is not a bona fide error if either there is a reasonable basis to
believe the error was intentional or there is evidence that the financial institution does not or has not maintained procedures
reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.
(c) Safe harbors —
(1) Incorrect entry for application date. A financial institution does not violate the Act or this subpart if it reports on its
small business lending application register an application date that is within three business days of the actual
application date pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(2).
(2) Incorrect entry for census tract.

For an application initially
submitted to a third party, see comment 107(a)(2)-3.
3. Indirect applications. For an application that was not submitted directly to the financial institution or its affiliate
(as described in § 1002.107(a)(4)), the financial institution shall report the date the application was received by
the party that initially received the application, the date the application was received by the financial institution, or
the date shown on the application form. Although a financial institution need not choose the same approach for
its entire small business lending application register, it should generally be consistent in its approach by, for
example, establishing procedures for how to report this date within particular scenarios, products, or divisions.
4. Safe harbor. Pursuant to § 1002.112(c)(1), a financial institution that reports on its small business lending
application register an application date that is within three business days of the actual application date pursuant
to § 1002.107(a)(2) does not violate the Act or subpart B of this part. For purposes of this paragraph, a business
day means any day the financial institution is open for business.
1. General. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(3) by reporting the means by which the applicant submitted the
application from one of the following options: in-person, telephone, online, or mail. If the financial institution retains multiple
versions of the application form, the institution reports the means by which the first application form satisfying the
definition of covered application pursuant to § 1002.103 was submitted.
i. In-person. A financial institution reports the application method as “in-person” if the applicant submitted the
application to the financial institution, or to another party acting on the financial institution's behalf, in person. The in-
person application method applies, for example, to applications submitted at a branch office (including applications
hand delivered by the applicant), at the applicant's place of business, or via electronic media with a video component).
ii. Telephone. A financial institution reports the application method as “telephone” if the applicant submitted the
application to the financial institution, or another party acting on the financial institution's behalf, by telephone call or
via audio-based electronic media without a video component.

","NOTE: The term surrogate in this context refers to any factor
related to a loan applicant that potentially identifies that
applicant’s race, color, or other prohibited basis
characteristic in instances where no direct evidence of that
characteristic is available. Thus, in consumer lending, where
monitoring data is generally unavailable, a Hispanic or Asian
surname could constitute a surrogate for an applicant’s race
or national origin because the examiner can assume that the
institution (which can rebut the presumption) perceived the
person to be Hispanic or Asian. Similarly, an applicant’s
given name could serve as a surrogate for his or her gender.
A surrogate for a prohibited basis group characteristic may be
used to set up a comparative analysis with control group
applicants or borrowers.
Examiners should then follow the rules in Steps Three
through Five, above and identify the possible discriminatory
patterns encountered and consider examining those products
determined to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct.
Step Seven: Identify Commercial Lending Discrimination
Risk Factors
Where an institution does a substantial amount of lending in
the commercial lending market, most notably small business
lending and the product has not recently been examined or
the underwriting standards have changed since the last
examination of the product, the examiner should consider
conducting a risk factor review similar to that performed for
residential lending products, as feasible, given the limited
information available. Such an analysis should generally be
limited to determining risk potential based on risk factors
U4- U8; P1-P3; R5-R7; and M1-M3.
If the institution makes commercial loans insured by the
Small Business Administration (SBA), determine from
agency supervisory staff whether SBA loan data (which
codes race and other factors) are available for the institution
and evaluate those data pursuant to instructions
accompanying them.
For large institutions reporting small business loans for
CRA purposes and where the institution also voluntarily
geocodes loan denials, look for material discrepancies in
ratios of approval-to-denial rates for applications in areas
with high concentrations of minority residents compared to
areas with concentrations of non-minority residents.
Articulate the possible discriminatory patterns identified
and consider further examining those products determined
to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct in
accordance with the procedures for commercial lending
described in Part III, F.
Step Eight: Complete the Scoping Process
To complete the scoping process, the examiner should
review the results of the preceding steps and select those
focal points that warrant examination, based on the relative
risk levels identified above. In order to remain within the
agency’s resource allowances, the examiner may need to
choose a smaller number of focal points from among all
those selected on the basis of risk. In such instances, set the
scope by first, prioritizing focal points on the basis of (i)
high number and/or relative severity of risk factors; (ii) high
data quality and other factors affecting the likelihood of
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.12 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
obtaining reliable examination results; (iii) high loan volume
and the likelihood of widespread risk to applicants and
borrowers; and (iv) low quality of any compliance program
and, second, selecting for examination review as many focal
points as resources permit.
Where the judgment process among competing focal points is
a close call, information learned in the phase of conducting the
compliance management review can be used to further refine
the examiner’s choices.
Part II — Compliance Management Review
The Compliance Management Review enables the
examination team to determine:
• The intensity of the current examination based on an
evaluation of the compliance management measures
employed by an institution.
• The reliability of the institution’s practices and procedures
for ensuring continued fair lending compliance.
Generally, the review should focus on:
• Determining whether the policies and procedures of the
institution enable management to prevent, or to identify
and self-correct, illegal disparate treatment in the
transactions that relate to the products and issues
identified for further analysis under Part I of these
procedures.
• Obtaining a thorough understanding of the manner by
which management addresses its fair lending
responsibilities with respect to (a) the institution’s lending
practices and standards, (b) training and other applicationprocessing aids, (c) guidance to employees or agents in
dealing with customers, and (d) its marketing or other
promotion of products and services.
To conduct this review, examiners should consider institutional
records and interviews with appropriate management personnel
in the lending, compliance, audit, and legal functions. The
examiner should also refer to the Compliance Management
Analysis Checklist contained in the Appendix to evaluate the
strength of the compliance programs in terms of their capacity
to prevent, or to identify and self- correct, fair lending
violations in connection with the products or issues selected for
analysis. Based on this evaluation:
• Set the intensity of the transaction analysis by minimizing
sample sizes within the guidelines established in Part III
and the Fair Lending Sample Size Tables in the
Appendix, to the extent warranted by the strength and
thoroughness of the compliance programs applicable to
those focal points selected for examination.

agency’s resource allowances, the examiner may need to
choose a smaller number of focal points from among all
those selected on the basis of risk. In such instances, set the
scope by first, prioritizing focal points on the basis of (i)
high number and/or relative severity of risk factors; (ii) high
data quality and other factors affecting the likelihood of

obtaining reliable examination results; (iii) high loan volume
and the likelihood of widespread risk to applicants and
borrowers; and (iv) low quality of any compliance program
and, second, selecting for examination review as many focal
points as resources permit.
Where the judgment process among competing focal points is
a close call, information learned in the phase of conducting the
compliance management review can be used to further refine
the examiner’s choices.
Part II — Compliance Management Review
The Compliance Management Review enables the
examination team to determine:
• The intensity of the current examination based on an
evaluation of the compliance management measures
employed by an institution.
• The reliability of the institution’s practices and procedures
for ensuring continued fair lending compliance.
Generally, the review should focus on:
• Determining whether the policies and procedures of the
institution enable management to prevent, or to identify
and self-correct, illegal disparate treatment in the
transactions that relate to the products and issues
identified for further analysis under Part I of these
procedures.
• Obtaining a thorough understanding of the manner by
which management addresses its fair lending
responsibilities with respect to (a) the institution’s lending
practices and standards, (b) training and other applicationprocessing aids, (c) guidance to employees or agents in
dealing with customers, and (d) its marketing or other
promotion of products and services.
To conduct this review, examiners should consider institutional
records and interviews with appropriate management personnel
in the lending, compliance, audit, and legal functions. The
examiner should also refer to the Compliance Management
Analysis Checklist contained in the Appendix to evaluate the
strength of the compliance programs in terms of their capacity
to prevent, or to identify and self- correct, fair lending
violations in connection with the products or issues selected for
analysis. Based on this evaluation:
• Set the intensity of the transaction analysis by minimizing
sample sizes within the guidelines established in Part III
and the Fair Lending Sample Size Tables in the
Appendix, to the extent warranted by the strength and
thoroughness of the compliance programs applicable to
those focal points selected for examination.

",Describe the safe harbor provision for reporting application dates on a small business lending application register.,"The safe harbor provision for reporting application dates on a small business lending application register allows financial institutions to use the date the application was received by the institution, rather than the date the application was completed by the applicant, as the application date. This provision aims to provide clarity and consistency in reporting practices for small business lending applications.","• Loan application forms.
• Home Mortgage Disclosure Act – Loan Application
Register (HMDA-LAR) or loan registers and lists of
declined applications.
• Description(s) of databases maintained for loan product(s)
to be reviewed.
","NOTE: The term surrogate in this context refers to any factor
related to a loan applicant that potentially identifies that
applicant’s race, color, or other prohibited basis
characteristic in instances where no direct evidence of that
characteristic is available. Thus, in consumer lending, where
monitoring data is generally unavailable, a Hispanic or Asian
surname could constitute a surrogate for an applicant’s race
or national origin because the examiner can assume that the
institution (which can rebut the presumption) perceived the
person to be Hispanic or Asian. Similarly, an applicant’s
given name could serve as a surrogate for his or her gender.
A surrogate for a prohibited basis group characteristic may be
used to set up a comparative analysis with control group
applicants or borrowers.
Examiners should then follow the rules in Steps Three
through Five, above and identify the possible discriminatory
patterns encountered and consider examining those products
determined to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct.
Step Seven: Identify Commercial Lending Discrimination
Risk Factors
Where an institution does a substantial amount of lending in
the commercial lending market, most notably small business
lending and the product has not recently been examined or
the underwriting standards have changed since the last
examination of the product, the examiner should consider
conducting a risk factor review similar to that performed for
residential lending products, as feasible, given the limited
information available. Such an analysis should generally be
limited to determining risk potential based on risk factors
U4- U8; P1-P3; R5-R7; and M1-M3.
If the institution makes commercial loans insured by the
Small Business Administration (SBA), determine from
agency supervisory staff whether SBA loan data (which
codes race and other factors) are available for the institution
and evaluate those data pursuant to instructions
accompanying them.
For large institutions reporting small business loans for
CRA purposes and where the institution also voluntarily
geocodes loan denials, look for material discrepancies in
ratios of approval-to-denial rates for applications in areas
with high concentrations of minority residents compared to
areas with concentrations of non-minority residents.
Articulate the possible discriminatory patterns identified
and consider further examining those products determined
to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct in
accordance with the procedures for commercial lending
described in Part III, F.
Step Eight: Complete the Scoping Process
To complete the scoping process, the examiner should
review the results of the preceding steps and select those
focal points that warrant examination, based on the relative
risk levels identified above. In order to remain within the
agency’s resource allowances, the examiner may need to
choose a smaller number of focal points from among all
those selected on the basis of risk. In such instances, set the
scope by first, prioritizing focal points on the basis of (i)
high number and/or relative severity of risk factors; (ii) high
data quality and other factors affecting the likelihood of

obtaining reliable examination results; (iii) high loan volume
and the likelihood of widespread risk to applicants and
borrowers; and (iv) low quality of any compliance program
and, second, selecting for examination review as many focal
points as resources permit.
Where the judgment process among competing focal points is
a close call, information learned in the phase of conducting the
compliance management review can be used to further refine
the examiner’s choices.

Paragraph 9(c)(3).
1. Oral inquiries for additional information. If an applicant fails to provide the information in response to an oral request, a creditor
must send a written notice to the applicant within the 30-day period specified in §§ 1002.9(c)(1) and (2). If the applicant provides the

This contact should be made promptly to ensure timely clarification on the denial reasons.,"Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
","Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.14 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Step 3. Compare Approved and Denied Applications
Overview: Although a creditor’s written policies and
procedures may appear to be nondiscriminatory, lending
personnel may interpret or apply policies in a
discriminatory manner. In order to detect any disparate
treatment among applicants, the examiner should first
eliminate all but “marginal transactions” (see 3.b. below)
from each selected focal point sample. Then, a detailed
profile of each marginal applicant’s qualifications, the
level of assistance received during the application process,
the reasons for denial, the loan terms, and other
information should be recorded on an Applicant Profile
Spreadsheet. Once profiled, the examiner can compare the
target and control groups for evidence that similarly
qualified applicants have been treated differently as to
either the institution’s credit decision or the quality of
assistance provided.
a. Create Applicant Profile Spreadsheet
Based upon the institution’s written and/or articulated
credit standards and loan policies, identify categories of
data that should be recorded for each applicant and
provide a field for each of these categories on a
worksheet or computerized spreadsheet. Certain data
(income, loan amount, debt, etc.) should always be
included in the spreadsheet, while the other data
selected will be tailored for each loan product and
institution based on applicable underwriting criteria
and such issues as branch location and underwriter.
Where credit bureau scores and/or application scores
are an element of the institution’s underwriting criteria
(or where such information is regularly recorded in
loan files, whether expressly used or not), include a
data field for this information in the spread sheet.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the quality of
assistance provided to target and control group applicants,
respectively, every work sheet should provide a
“comments” block appropriately labeled as the site for
recording observations from the file or interviews
regarding how an applicant was, or was not, assisted in
overcoming credit deficiencies or otherwise qualifying for
approval.
b. Complete Applicant Profiles
From the application files sample for each focal point,
complete applicant profiles for selected denied and
approved applications as follows:
• A principal goal is to identify cases where similarly
qualified prohibited basis and control group
applicants had different credit outcomes, because the
agencies have found that discrimination, including
differences in granting assistance during the approval
process, is more likely to occur with respect to
applicants who are not either clearly qualified or
unqualified ( i.e., “marginal” applicants). The
examiner-in-charge should, during the following
steps, judgmentally select from the initial sample
only those denied and approved applications which
constitute marginal transactions. (See Appendix on
Identifying Marginal Transactions for guidance)
• If few marginal control group applicants are identified
from the initial sample, review additional files of
approved control group applicants. This will either
increase the number of marginal approvals or confirm that
marginal approvals are so infrequent that the marginal
denials are unlikely to involve disparate treatment.
• The judgmental selection of both marginal-denied and
marginal-approved applicant loan files should be done
together, in a “back and forth” manner, to facilitate
close matches and a more consistent definition of
“marginal” between these two types of loan files.
• Once the marginal files have been identified, the data
elements called for on the profile spreadsheet are
extracted or noted and entered.
• While conducting the preceding step, the examiner
should simultaneously look for and document on the
spreadsheet any evidence found in marginal files
regarding the following:
° the extent of any assistance, including both
affirmative aid and waivers or partial waivers of
credit policy provisions or requirements, that
appears to have been provided to marginalapproved control group applicants which enabled
them to overcome one or more credit deficiencies,
such as excessive debt-to-income ratios; and
° the extent to which marginal-denied target group
applicants with similar deficiencies were, or were
not, provided similar affirmative aid, waivers or
other forms of assistance.
c. Review and Compare Profiles
• For each focal point, review all marginal profiles to determine
if the underwriter followed institution lending policies in
denying applications and whether the reason(s) for denial were
supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly
disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If any (a)
unexplained deviations from credit standards, (b) inaccurate
reasons for denial or (c) incorrect disclosures are noted,
(whether in a judgmental underwriting system, a scored
system or a mixed system) the examiner should obtain an
explanation from the underwriter and document the response
on an appropriate workpaper.
NOTE: In constructing the applicant profiles to be
compared, examiners must adjust the facts compared so that
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.15
assistance, waivers, or acts of discretion are treated
consistently between applicants. For example, if a control
group applicant’s DTI ratio was lowered to 42% because
the institution decided to include short-term overtime
income and a prohibited basis group applicant who was
denied due to “insufficient income” would have had his
ratio drop from 46% to 41% if his short-term overtime
income had been considered, then the examiners should
consider 41%, not 46%, in determining the benchmark.
• For each reason for denial identified within the target
group, rank the denied prohibited basis applicants,
beginning with the applicant whose qualification(s)
related to that reason for denial were least deficient.
(The top-ranked denied applicant in each such ranking
will be referred to below as the “benchmark”
applicant.)
• Compare each marginal control group approval to the
benchmark applicant in each reason-for-denial ranking
developed in step (b), above. If there are no approvals
who are equally or less qualified, then there are no
instances of disparate treatment for the institution to
account for. For all such approvals that appear no better
qualified than the denied benchmark applicant
o identify the approved loan on the worksheet or
spreadsheet as an “overlap approval,” and
o compare that overlap approval with other
marginal prohibited basis denials in the ranking to
determine whether additional overlaps exist. If
so, identify all overlapping approvals and denials
as above.
• Where the focal point involves use of a credit scoring
system, the analysis for disparate treatment is similar to
the procedures set forth in (c) above, and should focus
primarily on overrides of the scoring system itself. For
guidance on this type of analysis, refer to Considering
Automated Underwriting and Credit Scoring, Part C in
the Appendix.
","If an applicant wants to know the specific reasons for their credit denial, who should they contact and within what timeframe?",The applicant should contact the appropriate loan officer(s) to inquire about the specific reasons for their credit denial. This contact should be made within a reasonable timeframe following the denial of the credit application.,"Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review

of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover

• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.

IV – 1.14 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Step 3. Compare Approved and Denied Applications
Overview: Although a creditor’s written policies and
procedures may appear to be nondiscriminatory, lending
personnel may interpret or apply policies in a
discriminatory manner. In order to detect any disparate
treatment among applicants, the examiner should first
eliminate all but “marginal transactions” (see 3.b. below)
from each selected focal point sample. Then, a detailed
profile of each marginal applicant’s qualifications, the
level of assistance received during the application process,
the reasons for denial, the loan terms, and other
information should be recorded on an Applicant Profile
Spreadsheet. Once profiled, the examiner can compare the
target and control groups for evidence that similarly
qualified applicants have been treated differently as to
either the institution’s credit decision or the quality of
assistance provided.
a. Create Applicant Profile Spreadsheet
Based upon the institution’s written and/or articulated
credit standards and loan policies, identify categories of
data that should be recorded for each applicant and
provide a field for each of these categories on a
worksheet or computerized spreadsheet. Certain data
(income, loan amount, debt, etc.) should always be
included in the spreadsheet, while the other data
selected will be tailored for each loan product and
institution based on applicable underwriting criteria
and such issues as branch location and underwriter.
Where credit bureau scores and/or application scores
are an element of the institution’s underwriting criteria
(or where such information is regularly recorded in
loan files, whether expressly used or not), include a
data field for this information in the spread sheet.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the quality of
assistance provided to target and control group applicants,
respectively, every work sheet should provide a
“comments” block appropriately labeled as the site for
recording observations from the file or interviews
regarding how an applicant was, or was not, assisted in
overcoming credit deficiencies or otherwise qualifying for
approval.
b. Complete Applicant Profiles
From the application files sample for each focal point,
complete applicant profiles for selected denied and
approved applications as follows:
• A principal goal is to identify cases where similarly
qualified prohibited basis and control group
applicants had different credit outcomes, because the
agencies have found that discrimination, including
differences in granting assistance during the approval
process, is more likely to occur with respect to
applicants who are not either clearly qualified or
unqualified ( i.e., “marginal” applicants). The
examiner-in-charge should, during the following
steps, judgmentally select from the initial sample
only those denied and approved applications which
constitute marginal transactions. (See Appendix on
Identifying Marginal Transactions for guidance)
• If few marginal control group applicants are identified
from the initial sample, review additional files of
approved control group applicants. This will either
increase the number of marginal approvals or confirm that
marginal approvals are so infrequent that the marginal
denials are unlikely to involve disparate treatment.
• The judgmental selection of both marginal-denied and
marginal-approved applicant loan files should be done
together, in a “back and forth” manner, to facilitate
close matches and a more consistent definition of
“marginal” between these two types of loan files.
• Once the marginal files have been identified, the data
elements called for on the profile spreadsheet are
extracted or noted and entered.
• While conducting the preceding step, the examiner
should simultaneously look for and document on the
spreadsheet any evidence found in marginal files
regarding the following:
° the extent of any assistance, including both
affirmative aid and waivers or partial waivers of
credit policy provisions or requirements, that
appears to have been provided to marginalapproved control group applicants which enabled
them to overcome one or more credit deficiencies,
such as excessive debt-to-income ratios; and
° the extent to which marginal-denied target group
applicants with similar deficiencies were, or were
not, provided similar affirmative aid, waivers or
other forms of assistance.
c. Review and Compare Profiles
• For each focal point, review all marginal profiles to determine
if the underwriter followed institution lending policies in
denying applications and whether the reason(s) for denial were
supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly
disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If any (a)
unexplained deviations from credit standards, (b) inaccurate
reasons for denial or (c) incorrect disclosures are noted,
(whether in a judgmental underwriting system, a scored
system or a mixed system) the examiner should obtain an
explanation from the underwriter and document the response
on an appropriate workpaper.
NOTE: In constructing the applicant profiles to be
compared, examiners must adjust the facts compared so that
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.15
assistance, waivers, or acts of discretion are treated
consistently between applicants. For example, if a control
group applicant’s DTI ratio was lowered to 42% because
the institution decided to include short-term overtime
income and a prohibited basis group applicant who was
denied due to “insufficient income” would have had his
ratio drop from 46% to 41% if his short-term overtime
income had been considered, then the examiners should
consider 41%, not 46%, in determining the benchmark.
• For each reason for denial identified within the target
group, rank the denied prohibited basis applicants,
beginning with the applicant whose qualification(s)
related to that reason for denial were least deficient.
(The top-ranked denied applicant in each such ranking
will be referred to below as the “benchmark”
applicant.)
• Compare each marginal control group approval to the
benchmark applicant in each reason-for-denial ranking
developed in step (b), above. If there are no approvals
who are equally or less qualified, then there are no
instances of disparate treatment for the institution to
account for. For all such approvals that appear no better
qualified than the denied benchmark applicant
o identify the approved loan on the worksheet or
spreadsheet as an “overlap approval,” and
o compare that overlap approval with other
marginal prohibited basis denials in the ranking to
determine whether additional overlaps exist. If
so, identify all overlapping approvals and denials
as above.
• Where the focal point involves use of a credit scoring
system, the analysis for disparate treatment is similar to
the procedures set forth in (c) above, and should focus
primarily on overrides of the scoring system itself. For
guidance on this type of analysis, refer to Considering
Automated Underwriting and Credit Scoring, Part C in
the Appendix.
","If an applicant wants to know the specific reasons for their credit denial, who should they contact and within what timeframe?",The applicant should contact the underwriter responsible for their credit denial to inquire about the specific reasons for the denial. This contact should be made promptly after the denial to ensure timely clarification on the reasons for the decision.,"Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.

also any geographical terms used by the institution that

2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.

Step 3. Compare Approved and Denied Applications
Overview: Although a creditor’s written policies and
procedures may appear to be nondiscriminatory, lending
personnel may interpret or apply policies in a
discriminatory manner. In order to detect any disparate
treatment among applicants, the examiner should first
eliminate all but “marginal transactions” (see 3.b. below)
from each selected focal point sample. Then, a detailed
profile of each marginal applicant’s qualifications, the
level of assistance received during the application process,
the reasons for denial, the loan terms, and other
information should be recorded on an Applicant Profile
Spreadsheet. Once profiled, the examiner can compare the
target and control groups for evidence that similarly
qualified applicants have been treated differently as to
either the institution’s credit decision or the quality of
assistance provided.
a. Create Applicant Profile Spreadsheet
Based upon the institution’s written and/or articulated
credit standards and loan policies, identify categories of
data that should be recorded for each applicant and
provide a field for each of these categories on a
worksheet or computerized spreadsheet. Certain data
(income, loan amount, debt, etc.) should always be
included in the spreadsheet, while the other data
selected will be tailored for each loan product and
institution based on applicable underwriting criteria
and such issues as branch location and underwriter.
Where credit bureau scores and/or application scores
are an element of the institution’s underwriting criteria
(or where such information is regularly recorded in
loan files, whether expressly used or not), include a
data field for this information in the spread sheet.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the quality of
assistance provided to target and control group applicants,
respectively, every work sheet should provide a
“comments” block appropriately labeled as the site for
recording observations from the file or interviews
regarding how an applicant was, or was not, assisted in
overcoming credit deficiencies or otherwise qualifying for
approval.
b. Complete Applicant Profiles
From the application files sample for each focal point,
complete applicant profiles for selected denied and
approved applications as follows:
• A principal goal is to identify cases where similarly
qualified prohibited basis and control group
applicants had different credit outcomes, because the
agencies have found that discrimination, including
differences in granting assistance during the approval
process, is more likely to occur with respect to
applicants who are not either clearly qualified or
unqualified ( i.e., “marginal” applicants). The
examiner-in-charge should, during the following
steps, judgmentally select from the initial sample
only those denied and approved applications which
constitute marginal transactions. (See Appendix on
Identifying Marginal Transactions for guidance)
• If few marginal control group applicants are identified
from the initial sample, review additional files of
approved control group applicants. This will either
increase the number of marginal approvals or confirm that
marginal approvals are so infrequent that the marginal
denials are unlikely to involve disparate treatment.
• The judgmental selection of both marginal-denied and
marginal-approved applicant loan files should be done
together, in a “back and forth” manner, to facilitate
close matches and a more consistent definition of
“marginal” between these two types of loan files.
• Once the marginal files have been identified, the data
elements called for on the profile spreadsheet are
extracted or noted and entered.
• While conducting the preceding step, the examiner
should simultaneously look for and document on the
spreadsheet any evidence found in marginal files
regarding the following:
° the extent of any assistance, including both
affirmative aid and waivers or partial waivers of
credit policy provisions or requirements, that
appears to have been provided to marginalapproved control group applicants which enabled
them to overcome one or more credit deficiencies,
such as excessive debt-to-income ratios; and
° the extent to which marginal-denied target group
applicants with similar deficiencies were, or were
not, provided similar affirmative aid, waivers or
other forms of assistance.
c. Review and Compare Profiles
• For each focal point, review all marginal profiles to determine
if the underwriter followed institution lending policies in
denying applications and whether the reason(s) for denial were
supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly
disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If any (a)
unexplained deviations from credit standards, (b) inaccurate
reasons for denial or (c) incorrect disclosures are noted,
(whether in a judgmental underwriting system, a scored
system or a mixed system) the examiner should obtain an
explanation from the underwriter and document the response
on an appropriate workpaper.
NOTE: In constructing the applicant profiles to be
compared, examiners must adjust the facts compared so that
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.15
assistance, waivers, or acts of discretion are treated
consistently between applicants. For example, if a control
group applicant’s DTI ratio was lowered to 42% because
the institution decided to include short-term overtime
income and a prohibited basis group applicant who was
denied due to “insufficient income” would have had his
ratio drop from 46% to 41% if his short-term overtime
income had been considered, then the examiners should
consider 41%, not 46%, in determining the benchmark.
• For each reason for denial identified within the target
group, rank the denied prohibited basis applicants,
beginning with the applicant whose qualification(s)
related to that reason for denial were least deficient.
(The top-ranked denied applicant in each such ranking
will be referred to below as the “benchmark”
applicant.)
• Compare each marginal control group approval to the
benchmark applicant in each reason-for-denial ranking
developed in step (b), above. If there are no approvals
who are equally or less qualified, then there are no
instances of disparate treatment for the institution to
account for. For all such approvals that appear no better
qualified than the denied benchmark applicant
o identify the approved loan on the worksheet or
spreadsheet as an “overlap approval,” and
o compare that overlap approval with other
marginal prohibited basis denials in the ranking to
determine whether additional overlaps exist. If
so, identify all overlapping approvals and denials
as above.
• Where the focal point involves use of a credit scoring
system, the analysis for disparate treatment is similar to
the procedures set forth in (c) above, and should focus
primarily on overrides of the scoring system itself. For
guidance on this type of analysis, refer to Considering
Automated Underwriting and Credit Scoring, Part C in
the Appendix.
",correct,"The answer provided correctly addresses the question by stating that the applicant should contact the underwriter responsible for the credit decision to inquire about the specific reasons for their credit denial. It also emphasizes the importance of making this contact promptly to ensure timely clarification on the denial reasons, which aligns with the information provided in the reference text regarding the right to request specific reasons for credit denial within a certain timeframe.",
52,52,53,reg b,489e19351ec47f06,How can a low response rate for applicant-provided data indicate that a financial institution may have engaged in discouragement or failed to maintain reasonably designed procedures?,"A low response rate for applicant-provided data may suggest that a financial institution could be involved in discouragement or may have neglected to uphold appropriately designed procedures. This is because a low response rate indicates a lack of engagement from applicants when requested for data, which could potentially be a result of discouragement tactics or inadequacies in the institution's procedures.","For example, if an
applicant initially does not respond when asked early in the application process (before notifying the applicant of final
action taken on the application, pursuant to § 1002.107(c)(2)(i)) to inquiries made pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) and
(19), a financial institution may request this information again, for example, during a subsequent in-person meeting
with the applicant or after notifying the applicant of final action taken on the covered application.
1. Procedures to identify and respond to indicia of potential discouragement, including low response rates. Section 1002.107(c)
(3) requires a covered financial institution to maintain procedures designed to identify and respond to indicia of potential
discouragement, including low response rates for applicant-provided data. In general, these include monitoring for low
response rates (i.e., the percentage of covered applications for which the financial institution has obtained some type of
response to requests for applicant-provided data, including, as applicable, an applicant response of “I do not wish to provide
this information” or similar); monitoring for significant irregularities in any particular response that may indicate steering,
improper interference, or other potential discouragement or obstruction of applicants' preferred responses; monitoring
response rates and responses by division, location, loan officer, or other factors to ensure that no discouragement or
improper conduct is occurring in some parts of a financial institution, even if the financial institution maintains adequate
response rates and responses overall; providing adequate training to loan officers and other persons involved in collecting
applicant-provided data; promptly investigating any indicia of potential discouragement; and taking prompt remedial action
if discouragement or other improper conduct is identified.
1. In general. A low response rate for applicant-provided data may indicate that the financial institution has engaged in
discouragement or otherwise failed to maintain reasonably designed procedures. Response rate generally refers to whether
the financial institution has obtained some type of response to requests for applicant-provided data (including, as
applicable, an applicant response of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar). A response rate may be
measured, as appropriate, as compared to financial institutions of a similar size, type, and/or geographic reach, or other
factors, as appropriate.

factors, as appropriate. Similarly, significant irregularities in a particular response (for example, very high rates of an
applicant response of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar) may also indicate that a financial institution
does not have reasonably designed procedures, for example, because of steering, improper interference, or other potential
discouragement or obstruction of applicants' preferred responses. Response rates may be relevant across all applicant-
provided data, though are particularly relevant for the collection of the demographic data pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) and
(19) given the heightened sensitivity of these inquiries and the importance of those data to the purposes of subpart B.
1. In general. A financial institution may, for the purpose of reporting such data pursuant to § 1002.109, reuse certain
previously collected data if the requirements of § 1002.107(d) are met. In that circumstance, a financial institution need not
seek to collect the data anew in connection with a subsequent covered application to satisfy the requirements of this
subpart. For example, if an applicant applies for and is granted a term loan, and then subsequently applies for a credit card
in the same calendar year, the financial institution need not request again the data specified in § 1002.107(d). Similarly, if an
applicant applies for more than one covered credit transaction at one time, a financial institution need only ask once for the
data specified in § 1002.107(d).
2. Data that can be reused.",1,True,,How can a low response rate for applicant-provided data indicate that a financial institution may have engaged in discouragement or failed to maintain reasonably designed procedures?,"A low response rate for applicant-provided data can suggest that a financial institution may have engaged in discouragement or failed to maintain reasonably designed procedures because it could indicate a lack of effort or willingness on the part of the institution to collect necessary information from all applicants. This could potentially lead to incomplete or inaccurate data, which may impact the institution's ability to properly evaluate applicants and could result in discriminatory practices or inadequate assessments of creditworthiness.","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/

",How can a low response rate for applicant-provided data indicate that a financial institution may have engaged in discouragement or failed to maintain reasonably designed procedures?,"A low response rate for applicant-provided data can suggest that a financial institution may have engaged in discouragement or failed to maintain reasonably designed procedures because it could indicate a lack of effort in actively seeking and collecting necessary information from applicants. This could lead to incomplete or inaccurate data, potentially resulting in discriminatory practices or inadequate evaluation of applicants, which may violate fair lending laws and regulations.","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.

classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant

of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.

pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,

previous statements, information obtained from file
review, documents, reasonable banking practices, and
other sources, and satisfy common-sense standards of logic
and credibility.
a. Do not speculate or assume that the institution’s
decision- maker had specific intentions or
considerations in mind when he or she took the actions
being evaluated. Do not, for example, conclude that
because you have noticed a legitimate,
nondiscriminatory reason for a denial (such as an
applicant’s credit weakness), that no discrimination
occurred unless it is clear that, at the time of the denial,
the institution actually based the denial on that reason.

By clearly indicating the specific reasons for a credit decision, such as considering bank references separately from credit references, creditors provide applicants with a better understanding of why their application may have been approved or denied. This transparency helps promote fairness and accountability in the lending process, allowing applicants to address any deficiencies and improve their creditworthiness in the future.","For example, some creditors consider only references from banks or
other depository institutions and disregard finance company references altogether; their statement of reasons should

factors that creditors most commonly consider. If a creditor chooses to use the checklist of reasons provided in one of the
sample forms in this appendix and if reasons commonly used by the creditor are not provided on the form, the creditor
should modify the checklist by substituting or adding other reasons. For example, if “inadequate down payment” or “no

Step Six: Identify Consumer Lending Discrimination Risk
Factors
For any consumer loan products selected in Step One for risk
analysis, examiners should conduct a risk factor review similar
to that conducted for residential lending products in Steps
Three through Five, above. Examiners should consult with
agency supervisory staff regarding the potential use of
surrogates to identify possible prohibited basis group
individuals.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.

",Explain the importance of properly disclosing factors such as bank references and credit references in a creditor's notification forms.,"Properly disclosing factors such as bank references and credit references in a creditor's notification forms is crucial as it helps ensure transparency and accuracy in the lending process. By including these references, creditors can verify the financial history and creditworthiness of the applicant, which is essential for making informed lending decisions. Additionally, disclosing these factors can assist in assessing the applicant's ability to repay the loan and can help prevent discriminatory practices by providing a standardized and fair evaluation process for all applicants. This transparency also promotes compliance with fair lending laws and regulations by ensuring that lending decisions are based on objective criteria rather than subjective factors.","M6. *Proportion of prohibited basis applicants is

Review the risk factors identified in Step 4 and, for each loan
product that displays risk factors, articulate the possible
discriminatory effects encountered and organize the
examination of those loan products in accordance with the
following guidance. For complex issues regarding these
factors, consult with agency supervisory staff.
• Where overt evidence of discrimination, as described in
factors O1-O5, has been found in connection with a
product, document those findings as described in Part III,

consider conducting an underwriting comparative file
analysis as described in Part III, C.

consider conducting a marketing analysis as described in
Part III, H.
• Where an institution uses age in any credit scoring system,
consider conducting an examination analysis of that credit

Regulation B as described in Part III, I.
Step Six: Identify Consumer Lending Discrimination Risk
Factors
For any consumer loan products selected in Step One for risk
analysis, examiners should conduct a risk factor review similar
to that conducted for residential lending products in Steps
Three through Five, above. Examiners should consult with
agency supervisory staff regarding the potential use of
surrogates to identify possible prohibited basis group
individuals.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
",Explain the importance of properly disclosing factors such as bank references and credit references in a creditor's notification forms.,"Properly disclosing factors such as bank references and credit references in a creditor's notification forms is crucial as it helps ensure transparency in the lending process. By disclosing these factors accurately, creditors provide a comprehensive view of the applicant's financial history and creditworthiness. This transparency can help prevent discriminatory practices and ensure fair lending by allowing all relevant information to be considered in the credit decision-making process. Additionally, disclosing bank references and credit references can assist in verifying the applicant's financial stability and ability to repay the loan, which is essential for making informed lending decisions.","M6. *Proportion of prohibited basis applicants is

in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,

","According to the document, what are some of the factors that creditors are prohibited from discriminating against when considering credit applications?","Creditors are prohibited from discriminating against applicants, prospective applicants, or borrowers based on prohibited factors such as the characteristics of the individual, persons associated with the applicant, or the present or prospective occupants of the property to be financed or the neighborhood where the property is located. Additionally, creditors are required to make reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities to ensure equal opportunity in applying for credit.","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most

pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a

prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration

R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

by prohibited factors. If there are minority areas that the
institution excluded from the assessment area improperly,
consider whether they ought to be included in the redlining
analysis. Analyze the institution’s reasonably expected
market area in the same manner.
","Using Information Obtained During Scoping
Although the six tasks listed are presented below as
examination steps in the order given above, examiners should
recognize that a different order may be preferable in any given
examination. For example, the institution’s explanation (Step
5) for one of the policies or patterns in question may already
be documented in the CRA materials reviewed (Step 1) and
the CRA examiners may already have verified it, which may
be sufficient for purposes of the redlining analysis.
As another example, as part of the scoping process, the
examiners may have reviewed an analysis of the geographic
distribution of the institution’s loan originations with respect
to the racial and national origin composition of census tracts
within its CRA assessment or residential market area. Such
analysis might have documented the existence of significant
discrepancies between areas, by degree of minority
concentration, in loans originated (risk factor R1),
approval/denial rates (risk factor R2), and/or rates of denials
because of insufficient collateral (risk factor R3). In such a
situation in which the scoping process has produced a reliable
factual record, the examiners could begin with Step 5
(obtaining an explanation) of the redlining analysis below.
In contrast, when the scoping process only yields partial or
questionable information, or when the risk factors on which
the redlining analysis is based on complaints or allegations
against the institution, Steps 1-4 must be addressed.
Comparative analysis for redlining
Step 1. Identify and delineate any areas within the
institution’s CRA assessment area and reasonably expected
market area for residential products that are of a racial or
national origin minority character.
NOTE: The CRA assessment area can be a convenient unit
for redlining analysis because information about it typically
already is in hand. However, the CRA assessment area may
be too limited. The redlining analysis focuses on the
institution’s decisions about how much access to credit to
provide to different geographical areas. The areas for which
those decisions can best be compared are areas where the
institution actually marketed and provided credit and where
it could reasonably be expected to have marketed and
provided credit. Some of those areas might be beyond or
otherwise different from the CRA assessment area.
If there are no areas identifiable for their racial or national
origin minority character within the institution’s CRA
assessment area or reasonably expected market area for
residential products, a redlining analysis is not appropriate.
(If there is a substantial but dispersed minority population,
potential disparate treatment can be evaluated by a routine
comparative file review of applicants.)
This step may have been substantially completed during
scoping, but unresolved matters may remain. (For
example, several community spokespersons may allege that
the institution is redlining, but disagree in defining the
area). The examiners should:
a. Describe as precisely as possible why a specific area is
recognized in the community (perceptions of residents,
etc.) and/or is objectively identifiable (based on census
or other data) as having a particular racial or national
origin minority character.
• The most obvious identifier is the predominant race
or national origin of the residents of the area.
Examiners should document the percentages of
racial or national origin minorities residing within
the census tracts that make up the area. Analyzing
racial and national origin concentrations in quartiles
(such as 0 to <=25%, >25% to < = 50%, >50% to <=
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.21
75%, and >75%) or based on majority concentration
(0 to <=50%, and >50%) may be helpful. However,
examiners should bear in mind that it is illegal for
the institution to consider a prohibited factor in any
way. For example, an area or neighborhood may
only have a minority population of 20%, but if the
area’s concentration appears related to lending
practices, it would be appropriate to use that area’s
level of concentration in the analysis. Contacts with
community groups can be helpful to learn whether
there are such subtle features of racial or ethnic
character within a particular neighborhood.
• Geographical groupings that are convenient for CRA
may obscure racial patterns. For example, an
underserved, low-income, predominantly minority
neighborhood that lies within a larger low-income
area that primarily consisted of non-minority
neighborhoods may seem adequately served when
the entire low-income area is analyzed as a unit.
However, a racial pattern of underservice to minority
areas might be revealed if the low-income minority
neighborhood shared a border with an underserved,
middle-income, minority area and those two
minority areas were grouped together for purposes of
analysis.
b. Describe how the racial or national origin character
changes across the suspected redlining area’s
various boundaries.
c. Document or estimate the demand for credit, within the
minority area. This may include the applicable
demographics of the area, including the percentage of
homeowners, the median house value, median family
income, or the number of small businesses, etc. Review
the institution’s non-originated loan applications from
the suspected redlined areas. If available, review
aggregate institution data for loans originated and
applications received from the suspected redlined areas.
Community contacts may also be helpful in determining
the demand for such credit. If the minority area does not
have a significant amount of demand for such credit, the
area is not appropriate for a redlining analysis.
Step 2. Determine whether any minority area identified in
Step 1 is excluded, under-served, selectively excluded from
marketing efforts, or otherwise less-favorably treated in
any way by the institution.
The examiners should begin with the risk factors identified
during the scoping process. The unfavorable treatment may
have been substantially documented during scoping and needs
only to be finished in this step. If not, this step will verify and
measure the extent to which HMDA data show the minority
areas identified in Step 1 to be underserved and/or how the
institution’s explicit policies treat them less favorably.
a. Review prior CRA lending test analyses to learn whether
they have identified any excluded or otherwise underserved areas or other significant geographical disparities in
the institution’s lending. Determine whether any of those
are the minority areas identified in Step 1.
b. Learn from the institution itself whether, as a matter of
policy, it treats any separate or distinct geographical areas
within its marketing or service area differently from other
areas. This may have been done completely or partially
during scoping analysis related to risk factors R5-R9.
The differences in treatment can be in marketing,
products offered, branch operations (including the
services provided and the hours of operation), appraisal
practices, application processing, approval requirements,
pricing, loan conditions, evaluation of collateral, or any
other policy or practice materially related to access to
credit. Determine whether any of those less-favored areas
are the minority areas identified in Step 1.
c. Obtain from the institution: (i) its reasons for such
differences in policy, (ii) how the differences are
implemented, and (iii) any specific conditions that must
exist in an area for it to receive the particular treatment
(more favorable or less favorable) that the institution has
indicated.
Step 3. Identify and delineate any areas within the
institution’s CRA assessment area and reasonably
expected market area for residential products that are
non-minority in character and that the institution appears
to treat more favorably.
To the extent not already completed during scoping:
a. Document the percentages of control group and of
racial or national origin minorities residing within the
census tract(s) that comprise(s) the non-minority area.
b. Document the nature of the housing stock in the
area.
c. Describe, to the extent known, how the institution’s
practices, policies, or its rate of lending change
from less-to more-favorable as one leaves the
minority area at its various boundaries. (Examiners
should be particularly attentive to instances in
which the boundaries between favored and
disfavored areas deviate from boundaries the
institution would reasonably be expected to follow,
such as political boundaries or transportation
barriers.)
d. Examiners should particularly consider whether, within
a large area that is composed predominantly of racial or
national origin minority households, there are enclaves
that are predominantly non-minority or whether, along
the area’s borders, there are irregularities where the
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.22 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
non- minority group is predominant. As part of the
overall comparison, examiners should determine
whether credit access within those small non-minority
areas differs from credit access in the larger minority
area.

applications received from the suspected redlined areas.
Community contacts may also be helpful in determining
the demand for such credit. If the minority area does not

factual record, the examiners could begin with Step 5
(obtaining an explanation) of the redlining analysis below.
In contrast, when the scoping process only yields partial or
questionable information, or when the risk factors on which
the redlining analysis is based on complaints or allegations
against the institution, Steps 1-4 must be addressed.
Comparative analysis for redlining
Step 1. Identify and delineate any areas within the
institution’s CRA assessment area and reasonably expected
market area for residential products that are of a racial or
national origin minority character.
NOTE: The CRA assessment area can be a convenient unit
for redlining analysis because information about it typically
already is in hand. However, the CRA assessment area may
be too limited. The redlining analysis focuses on the
institution’s decisions about how much access to credit to
provide to different geographical areas. The areas for which
those decisions can best be compared are areas where the
institution actually marketed and provided credit and where
it could reasonably be expected to have marketed and
provided credit. Some of those areas might be beyond or
otherwise different from the CRA assessment area.
If there are no areas identifiable for their racial or national
origin minority character within the institution’s CRA
assessment area or reasonably expected market area for
residential products, a redlining analysis is not appropriate.
(If there is a substantial but dispersed minority population,
potential disparate treatment can be evaluated by a routine
comparative file review of applicants.)
This step may have been substantially completed during
scoping, but unresolved matters may remain. (For
example, several community spokespersons may allege that
the institution is redlining, but disagree in defining the
area). The examiners should:
a. Describe as precisely as possible why a specific area is
recognized in the community (perceptions of residents,
etc.) and/or is objectively identifiable (based on census
or other data) as having a particular racial or national
origin minority character.
• The most obvious identifier is the predominant race
or national origin of the residents of the area.
Examiners should document the percentages of
racial or national origin minorities residing within
the census tracts that make up the area. Analyzing
racial and national origin concentrations in quartiles
(such as 0 to <=25%, >25% to < = 50%, >50% to <=
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.21
75%, and >75%) or based on majority concentration
(0 to <=50%, and >50%) may be helpful. However,
examiners should bear in mind that it is illegal for
the institution to consider a prohibited factor in any
way. For example, an area or neighborhood may
only have a minority population of 20%, but if the
area’s concentration appears related to lending
practices, it would be appropriate to use that area’s
level of concentration in the analysis. Contacts with
community groups can be helpful to learn whether
there are such subtle features of racial or ethnic
character within a particular neighborhood.
• Geographical groupings that are convenient for CRA
may obscure racial patterns. For example, an
underserved, low-income, predominantly minority
neighborhood that lies within a larger low-income
area that primarily consisted of non-minority
neighborhoods may seem adequately served when
the entire low-income area is analyzed as a unit.
However, a racial pattern of underservice to minority
areas might be revealed if the low-income minority
neighborhood shared a border with an underserved,
middle-income, minority area and those two
minority areas were grouped together for purposes of
analysis.
b. Describe how the racial or national origin character
changes across the suspected redlining area’s
various boundaries.
c. Document or estimate the demand for credit, within the
minority area. This may include the applicable
demographics of the area, including the percentage of
homeowners, the median house value, median family
income, or the number of small businesses, etc. Review
the institution’s non-originated loan applications from
the suspected redlined areas. If available, review
aggregate institution data for loans originated and
applications received from the suspected redlined areas.
Community contacts may also be helpful in determining
the demand for such credit. If the minority area does not
have a significant amount of demand for such credit, the
area is not appropriate for a redlining analysis.
Step 2. Determine whether any minority area identified in
Step 1 is excluded, under-served, selectively excluded from
marketing efforts, or otherwise less-favorably treated in
any way by the institution.
The examiners should begin with the risk factors identified
during the scoping process. The unfavorable treatment may
have been substantially documented during scoping and needs
only to be finished in this step. If not, this step will verify and
measure the extent to which HMDA data show the minority
areas identified in Step 1 to be underserved and/or how the
institution’s explicit policies treat them less favorably.
a. Review prior CRA lending test analyses to learn whether
they have identified any excluded or otherwise underserved areas or other significant geographical disparities in
the institution’s lending. Determine whether any of those
are the minority areas identified in Step 1.
b. Learn from the institution itself whether, as a matter of
policy, it treats any separate or distinct geographical areas
within its marketing or service area differently from other
areas. This may have been done completely or partially
during scoping analysis related to risk factors R5-R9.
The differences in treatment can be in marketing,
products offered, branch operations (including the
services provided and the hours of operation), appraisal
practices, application processing, approval requirements,
pricing, loan conditions, evaluation of collateral, or any
other policy or practice materially related to access to
credit. Determine whether any of those less-favored areas
are the minority areas identified in Step 1.
c. Obtain from the institution: (i) its reasons for such
differences in policy, (ii) how the differences are
implemented, and (iii) any specific conditions that must
exist in an area for it to receive the particular treatment
(more favorable or less favorable) that the institution has
indicated.
Step 3. Identify and delineate any areas within the
institution’s CRA assessment area and reasonably
expected market area for residential products that are
non-minority in character and that the institution appears
to treat more favorably.
To the extent not already completed during scoping:
a. Document the percentages of control group and of
racial or national origin minorities residing within the
census tract(s) that comprise(s) the non-minority area.
b. Document the nature of the housing stock in the
area.
c. Describe, to the extent known, how the institution’s
practices, policies, or its rate of lending change
from less-to more-favorable as one leaves the
minority area at its various boundaries. (Examiners
should be particularly attentive to instances in
which the boundaries between favored and
disfavored areas deviate from boundaries the
institution would reasonably be expected to follow,
such as political boundaries or transportation
barriers.)
d. Examiners should particularly consider whether, within
a large area that is composed predominantly of racial or
national origin minority households, there are enclaves
that are predominantly non-minority or whether, along
the area’s borders, there are irregularities where the
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.22 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
non- minority group is predominant. As part of the
overall comparison, examiners should determine
whether credit access within those small non-minority
areas differs from credit access in the larger minority
area.
",How does the financial institution determine the census tract based on the three types of addresses or locations listed in the document?,"The financial institution determines the census tract based on the racial or national origin minority character, non-minority character, and the boundaries of the suspected redlining area.","Step 4. Identify the location of any minority areas located
just outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and
market area for residential products, such that the
institution may be purposely avoiding such areas.
Review the analysis from prior CRA examinations of
whether the assessment area appears to have been influenced
by prohibited factors. If there are minority areas that the
institution excluded from the assessment area improperly,
consider whether they ought to be included in the redlining
analysis. Analyze the institution’s reasonably expected
market area in the same manner.
","Using Information Obtained During Scoping
Although the six tasks listed are presented below as
examination steps in the order given above, examiners should
recognize that a different order may be preferable in any given
examination. For example, the institution’s explanation (Step
5) for one of the policies or patterns in question may already
be documented in the CRA materials reviewed (Step 1) and
the CRA examiners may already have verified it, which may
be sufficient for purposes of the redlining analysis.
As another example, as part of the scoping process, the
examiners may have reviewed an analysis of the geographic
distribution of the institution’s loan originations with respect
to the racial and national origin composition of census tracts
within its CRA assessment or residential market area. Such
analysis might have documented the existence of significant
discrepancies between areas, by degree of minority
concentration, in loans originated (risk factor R1),
approval/denial rates (risk factor R2), and/or rates of denials
because of insufficient collateral (risk factor R3). In such a
situation in which the scoping process has produced a reliable
factual record, the examiners could begin with Step 5
(obtaining an explanation) of the redlining analysis below.
In contrast, when the scoping process only yields partial or
questionable information, or when the risk factors on which
the redlining analysis is based on complaints or allegations
against the institution, Steps 1-4 must be addressed.

A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a

A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).

Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.1
Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","What types of state laws are considered inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this part, and therefore preempted?",State laws that are considered inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and Regulation B are those that conflict with or contradict the provisions outlined in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B.,"• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.

are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","What types of state laws are considered inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this part, and therefore preempted?","State laws that are considered inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and Regulation B are those that would hinder or contradict the prohibition of discrimination based on the specified factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or other protected characteristics in any aspect of a credit transaction.","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","c. How and when the statement or practice was
disseminated or put into effect.
d. How widely the statement or practice was disseminated
or applied.
e. Whether and to what extent applicants were
adversely affected by the statement or practice.
Assemble findings and supporting documentation for
presentation to management in connection with Part IV of
these procedures.
C. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Residential and
Consumer Loans.
Step 1. Set Sample Size
a. For each focal point selected for this analysis, two
samples will be utilized: (i) prohibited basis group denials
and (ii) control group approvals, both identified either
directly from monitoring information in the case of
residential loan applications or through the use of
application data or surrogates in the case of consumer
applications.
b. Refer to Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table A in the
Appendix and determine the size of the initial sample for
each focal point, based on the number of prohibited basis
group denials and the number of control group approvals
by the institution during the twelve month (or calendar
year) period of lending activity preceding the
examination.
In the event that the number of denials and/or approvals
acted on during the preceding 12 month period
substantially exceeds the maximum sample size shown
in Table A, reduce the time period from which that
sample is selected to a shorter period. (In doing so,
make every effort to select a period in which the
institution’s underwriting standards are most
representative of those in effect during the full 12
month period preceding the examination.)
c. If the number of prohibited basis group denials or
control group approvals for a given focal point that were
acted upon during the 12 month period referenced in
1.b., above, do not meet the minimum standards set forth
in the Sample Size Table, examiners need not attempt a
transactional analysis for that focal point. Where other
risk factors favor analyzing such a focal point, consult
with agency supervisory staff on possible alternative
methods of judgmental comparative analysis.
d. If agency policy calls for a different approach to
sampling (e.g., a form of statistical analysis, a
mathematical formula, or an automated tool) for a
limited class of institutions, examiners should follow
that approach.
Step 2. Determine Sample Composition
a. To the extent the institution maintains records of loan
outcomes resulting from exceptions to its credit
underwriting standards or other policies (e.g., overrides
to credit score cutoffs), request such records for both
approvals and denials, sorted by loan product and
branch or decision center, if the institution can do so.
Include in the initial sample for each focal point all
exceptions or overrides applicable to that focal point.
b. Using HMDA/LAR data or, for consumer loans,
comparable loan register data to the extent
available, choose approved and denied
applications based on selection criteria that will
maximize the likelihood of finding marginal
approved and denied applicants, as discussed
below.
c. To the extent that the above factors are inapplicable or
other selection criteria are unavailable or do not
facilitate selection of the entire sample size of files,
complete the initial sample selection by making random
file selections from the appropriate sample categories in
the Sample Size Table.
IV.

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

disseminated or put into effect.
d. How widely the statement or practice was disseminated
or applied.
e. Whether and to what extent applicants were
adversely affected by the statement or practice.
Assemble findings and supporting documentation for
presentation to management in connection with Part IV of
these procedures.
C. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Residential and
Consumer Loans.
Step 1. Set Sample Size
a. For each focal point selected for this analysis, two
samples will be utilized: (i) prohibited basis group denials
and (ii) control group approvals, both identified either
directly from monitoring information in the case of
residential loan applications or through the use of
application data or surrogates in the case of consumer
applications.
b. Refer to Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table A in the
Appendix and determine the size of the initial sample for
each focal point, based on the number of prohibited basis
group denials and the number of control group approvals
by the institution during the twelve month (or calendar
year) period of lending activity preceding the
examination.
In the event that the number of denials and/or approvals
acted on during the preceding 12 month period
substantially exceeds the maximum sample size shown
in Table A, reduce the time period from which that
sample is selected to a shorter period. (In doing so,
make every effort to select a period in which the
institution’s underwriting standards are most
representative of those in effect during the full 12
month period preceding the examination.)
c. If the number of prohibited basis group denials or
control group approvals for a given focal point that were
acted upon during the 12 month period referenced in
1.b., above, do not meet the minimum standards set forth
in the Sample Size Table, examiners need not attempt a
transactional analysis for that focal point. Where other
risk factors favor analyzing such a focal point, consult
with agency supervisory staff on possible alternative
methods of judgmental comparative analysis.
d. If agency policy calls for a different approach to
sampling (e.g., a form of statistical analysis, a
mathematical formula, or an automated tool) for a
limited class of institutions, examiners should follow
that approach.
Step 2. Determine Sample Composition
a. To the extent the institution maintains records of loan
outcomes resulting from exceptions to its credit
underwriting standards or other policies (e.g., overrides
to credit score cutoffs), request such records for both
approvals and denials, sorted by loan product and
branch or decision center, if the institution can do so.
Include in the initial sample for each focal point all
exceptions or overrides applicable to that focal point.
b. Using HMDA/LAR data or, for consumer loans,
comparable loan register data to the extent
available, choose approved and denied
applications based on selection criteria that will
maximize the likelihood of finding marginal
approved and denied applicants, as discussed
below.
c. To the extent that the above factors are inapplicable or
other selection criteria are unavailable or do not
facilitate selection of the entire sample size of files,
complete the initial sample selection by making random
file selections from the appropriate sample categories in
the Sample Size Table.

Ethnicity, race, or sex of principal owners not provided by applicant. Pursuant to § 1002.107(c), a financial institution shall
maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which includes the ethnicity, race, and sex of
an applicant's principal owners. However, if an applicant does not provide the information, such as in response to a request
for a principal owner's ethnicity, race, or sex on a paper or electronic data collection form, the financial institution reports
the ethnicity, race, or sex (as applicable) as “not provided by applicant” for that principal owner. For example, if the financial
institution provides a paper data collection form to an applicant with two principal owners, and asks the applicant to
complete and return the form but the applicant does not do so, the financial institution reports that the two principal
owners' ethnicity, race, and sex were “not provided by applicant.
” Similarly, if the financial institution provides an electronic
data collection form, the applicant indicates that it has two principal owners, the applicant provides ethnicity, race, and sex
for the first principal owner, and the applicant does not make any selections for the second principal owner's ethnicity, race,
and sex, the financial institution reports the ethnicity, race, and sex that the applicant provided for the first principal owner
and reports that each of the ethnicity, race, and sex for the second principal owner was “not provided by applicant.
”
Additionally, if the financial institution provides an electronic or paper data collection form, the applicant indicates that it
has one principal owner, provides the principal owner's ethnicity and sex information, but does not provide information
about the principal owner's race and also does not select a response of “I do not wish to provide this information” with
regard to race, the financial institution reports the ethnicity and sex provided by the applicant and reports that the race of
the principal owner was “not provided by applicant.

where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.

Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special

R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.

all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary

been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","NOTE: The term surrogate in this context refers to any factor
related to a loan applicant that potentially identifies that
applicant’s race, color, or other prohibited basis
characteristic in instances where no direct evidence of that
characteristic is available. Thus, in consumer lending, where
monitoring data is generally unavailable, a Hispanic or Asian
surname could constitute a surrogate for an applicant’s race
or national origin because the examiner can assume that the
institution (which can rebut the presumption) perceived the
person to be Hispanic or Asian. Similarly, an applicant’s
given name could serve as a surrogate for his or her gender.
A surrogate for a prohibited basis group characteristic may be
used to set up a comparative analysis with control group
applicants or borrowers.
Examiners should then follow the rules in Steps Three
through Five, above and identify the possible discriminatory
patterns encountered and consider examining those products
determined to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct.
Step Seven: Identify Commercial Lending Discrimination
Risk Factors
Where an institution does a substantial amount of lending in
the commercial lending market, most notably small business
lending and the product has not recently been examined or
the underwriting standards have changed since the last
examination of the product, the examiner should consider
conducting a risk factor review similar to that performed for
residential lending products, as feasible, given the limited
information available. Such an analysis should generally be
limited to determining risk potential based on risk factors
U4- U8; P1-P3; R5-R7; and M1-M3.
If the institution makes commercial loans insured by the
Small Business Administration (SBA), determine from
agency supervisory staff whether SBA loan data (which
codes race and other factors) are available for the institution
and evaluate those data pursuant to instructions
accompanying them.
For large institutions reporting small business loans for
CRA purposes and where the institution also voluntarily
geocodes loan denials, look for material discrepancies in
ratios of approval-to-denial rates for applications in areas
with high concentrations of minority residents compared to
areas with concentrations of non-minority residents.
Articulate the possible discriminatory patterns identified
and consider further examining those products determined
to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct in
accordance with the procedures for commercial lending
described in Part III, F.
Step Eight: Complete the Scoping Process
To complete the scoping process, the examiner should
review the results of the preceding steps and select those
focal points that warrant examination, based on the relative
risk levels identified above. In order to remain within the
agency’s resource allowances, the examiner may need to
choose a smaller number of focal points from among all
those selected on the basis of risk. In such instances, set the
scope by first, prioritizing focal points on the basis of (i)
high number and/or relative severity of risk factors; (ii) high
data quality and other factors affecting the likelihood of
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.12 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
obtaining reliable examination results; (iii) high loan volume
and the likelihood of widespread risk to applicants and
borrowers; and (iv) low quality of any compliance program
and, second, selecting for examination review as many focal
points as resources permit.
Where the judgment process among competing focal points is
a close call, information learned in the phase of conducting the
compliance management review can be used to further refine
the examiner’s choices.
Part II — Compliance Management Review
The Compliance Management Review enables the
examination team to determine:
• The intensity of the current examination based on an
evaluation of the compliance management measures
employed by an institution.
• The reliability of the institution’s practices and procedures
for ensuring continued fair lending compliance.
Generally, the review should focus on:
• Determining whether the policies and procedures of the
institution enable management to prevent, or to identify
and self-correct, illegal disparate treatment in the
transactions that relate to the products and issues
identified for further analysis under Part I of these
procedures.
• Obtaining a thorough understanding of the manner by
which management addresses its fair lending
responsibilities with respect to (a) the institution’s lending
practices and standards, (b) training and other applicationprocessing aids, (c) guidance to employees or agents in
dealing with customers, and (d) its marketing or other
promotion of products and services.
To conduct this review, examiners should consider institutional
records and interviews with appropriate management personnel
in the lending, compliance, audit, and legal functions. The
examiner should also refer to the Compliance Management
Analysis Checklist contained in the Appendix to evaluate the
strength of the compliance programs in terms of their capacity
to prevent, or to identify and self- correct, fair lending
violations in connection with the products or issues selected for
analysis. Based on this evaluation:
• Set the intensity of the transaction analysis by minimizing
sample sizes within the guidelines established in Part III
and the Fair Lending Sample Size Tables in the
Appendix, to the extent warranted by the strength and
thoroughness of the compliance programs applicable to
those focal points selected for examination.

overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or

applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.

credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific

lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to

relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at

R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","NOTE: The term surrogate in this context refers to any factor
related to a loan applicant that potentially identifies that
applicant’s race, color, or other prohibited basis
characteristic in instances where no direct evidence of that
characteristic is available. Thus, in consumer lending, where
monitoring data is generally unavailable, a Hispanic or Asian
surname could constitute a surrogate for an applicant’s race
or national origin because the examiner can assume that the
institution (which can rebut the presumption) perceived the
person to be Hispanic or Asian. Similarly, an applicant’s
given name could serve as a surrogate for his or her gender.
A surrogate for a prohibited basis group characteristic may be
used to set up a comparative analysis with control group
applicants or borrowers.
Examiners should then follow the rules in Steps Three
through Five, above and identify the possible discriminatory
patterns encountered and consider examining those products
determined to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct.
Step Seven: Identify Commercial Lending Discrimination
Risk Factors
Where an institution does a substantial amount of lending in
the commercial lending market, most notably small business
lending and the product has not recently been examined or
the underwriting standards have changed since the last
examination of the product, the examiner should consider
conducting a risk factor review similar to that performed for
residential lending products, as feasible, given the limited
information available. Such an analysis should generally be
limited to determining risk potential based on risk factors
U4- U8; P1-P3; R5-R7; and M1-M3.
If the institution makes commercial loans insured by the
Small Business Administration (SBA), determine from
agency supervisory staff whether SBA loan data (which
codes race and other factors) are available for the institution
and evaluate those data pursuant to instructions
accompanying them.
For large institutions reporting small business loans for
CRA purposes and where the institution also voluntarily
geocodes loan denials, look for material discrepancies in
ratios of approval-to-denial rates for applications in areas
with high concentrations of minority residents compared to
areas with concentrations of non-minority residents.
Articulate the possible discriminatory patterns identified
and consider further examining those products determined
to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct in
accordance with the procedures for commercial lending
described in Part III, F.
Step Eight: Complete the Scoping Process
To complete the scoping process, the examiner should
review the results of the preceding steps and select those
focal points that warrant examination, based on the relative
risk levels identified above. In order to remain within the
agency’s resource allowances, the examiner may need to
choose a smaller number of focal points from among all
those selected on the basis of risk. In such instances, set the
scope by first, prioritizing focal points on the basis of (i)
high number and/or relative severity of risk factors; (ii) high
data quality and other factors affecting the likelihood of
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.12 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
obtaining reliable examination results; (iii) high loan volume
and the likelihood of widespread risk to applicants and
borrowers; and (iv) low quality of any compliance program
and, second, selecting for examination review as many focal
points as resources permit.
Where the judgment process among competing focal points is
a close call, information learned in the phase of conducting the
compliance management review can be used to further refine
the examiner’s choices.
Part II — Compliance Management Review
The Compliance Management Review enables the
examination team to determine:
• The intensity of the current examination based on an
evaluation of the compliance management measures
employed by an institution.
• The reliability of the institution’s practices and procedures
for ensuring continued fair lending compliance.
Generally, the review should focus on:
• Determining whether the policies and procedures of the
institution enable management to prevent, or to identify
and self-correct, illegal disparate treatment in the
transactions that relate to the products and issues
identified for further analysis under Part I of these
procedures.
• Obtaining a thorough understanding of the manner by
which management addresses its fair lending
responsibilities with respect to (a) the institution’s lending
practices and standards, (b) training and other applicationprocessing aids, (c) guidance to employees or agents in
dealing with customers, and (d) its marketing or other
promotion of products and services.
To conduct this review, examiners should consider institutional
records and interviews with appropriate management personnel
in the lending, compliance, audit, and legal functions. The
examiner should also refer to the Compliance Management
Analysis Checklist contained in the Appendix to evaluate the
strength of the compliance programs in terms of their capacity
to prevent, or to identify and self- correct, fair lending
violations in connection with the products or issues selected for
analysis. Based on this evaluation:
• Set the intensity of the transaction analysis by minimizing
sample sizes within the guidelines established in Part III
and the Fair Lending Sample Size Tables in the
Appendix, to the extent warranted by the strength and
thoroughness of the compliance programs applicable to
those focal points selected for examination.

predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","NOTE: The term surrogate in this context refers to any factor
related to a loan applicant that potentially identifies that
applicant’s race, color, or other prohibited basis
characteristic in instances where no direct evidence of that
characteristic is available. Thus, in consumer lending, where
monitoring data is generally unavailable, a Hispanic or Asian
surname could constitute a surrogate for an applicant’s race
or national origin because the examiner can assume that the
institution (which can rebut the presumption) perceived the
person to be Hispanic or Asian. Similarly, an applicant’s
given name could serve as a surrogate for his or her gender.
A surrogate for a prohibited basis group characteristic may be
used to set up a comparative analysis with control group
applicants or borrowers.
Examiners should then follow the rules in Steps Three
through Five, above and identify the possible discriminatory
patterns encountered and consider examining those products
determined to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct.
Step Seven: Identify Commercial Lending Discrimination
Risk Factors
Where an institution does a substantial amount of lending in
the commercial lending market, most notably small business
lending and the product has not recently been examined or
the underwriting standards have changed since the last
examination of the product, the examiner should consider
conducting a risk factor review similar to that performed for
residential lending products, as feasible, given the limited
information available. Such an analysis should generally be
limited to determining risk potential based on risk factors
U4- U8; P1-P3; R5-R7; and M1-M3.
If the institution makes commercial loans insured by the
Small Business Administration (SBA), determine from
agency supervisory staff whether SBA loan data (which
codes race and other factors) are available for the institution
and evaluate those data pursuant to instructions
accompanying them.
For large institutions reporting small business loans for
CRA purposes and where the institution also voluntarily
geocodes loan denials, look for material discrepancies in
ratios of approval-to-denial rates for applications in areas
with high concentrations of minority residents compared to
areas with concentrations of non-minority residents.
Articulate the possible discriminatory patterns identified
and consider further examining those products determined
to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct in
accordance with the procedures for commercial lending
described in Part III, F.
Step Eight: Complete the Scoping Process
To complete the scoping process, the examiner should
review the results of the preceding steps and select those
focal points that warrant examination, based on the relative
risk levels identified above. In order to remain within the
agency’s resource allowances, the examiner may need to
choose a smaller number of focal points from among all
those selected on the basis of risk. In such instances, set the
scope by first, prioritizing focal points on the basis of (i)
high number and/or relative severity of risk factors; (ii) high
data quality and other factors affecting the likelihood of
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.12 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
obtaining reliable examination results; (iii) high loan volume
and the likelihood of widespread risk to applicants and
borrowers; and (iv) low quality of any compliance program
and, second, selecting for examination review as many focal
points as resources permit.
Where the judgment process among competing focal points is
a close call, information learned in the phase of conducting the
compliance management review can be used to further refine
the examiner’s choices.
Part II — Compliance Management Review
The Compliance Management Review enables the
examination team to determine:
• The intensity of the current examination based on an
evaluation of the compliance management measures
employed by an institution.
• The reliability of the institution’s practices and procedures
for ensuring continued fair lending compliance.
Generally, the review should focus on:
• Determining whether the policies and procedures of the
institution enable management to prevent, or to identify
and self-correct, illegal disparate treatment in the
transactions that relate to the products and issues
identified for further analysis under Part I of these
procedures.
• Obtaining a thorough understanding of the manner by
which management addresses its fair lending
responsibilities with respect to (a) the institution’s lending
practices and standards, (b) training and other applicationprocessing aids, (c) guidance to employees or agents in
dealing with customers, and (d) its marketing or other
promotion of products and services.
To conduct this review, examiners should consider institutional
records and interviews with appropriate management personnel
in the lending, compliance, audit, and legal functions. The
examiner should also refer to the Compliance Management
Analysis Checklist contained in the Appendix to evaluate the
strength of the compliance programs in terms of their capacity
to prevent, or to identify and self- correct, fair lending
violations in connection with the products or issues selected for
analysis. Based on this evaluation:
• Set the intensity of the transaction analysis by minimizing
sample sizes within the guidelines established in Part III
and the Fair Lending Sample Size Tables in the
Appendix, to the extent warranted by the strength and
thoroughness of the compliance programs applicable to
those focal points selected for examination.
 3 This reflects the interagency examination procedures in their entirety.

Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.

The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or

",correct,"The answer correctly addresses the requirements that creditors must adhere to according to the regulation mentioned. It mentions prohibiting discrimination based on various factors, following specific lending acts and practices outlined in Regulation B, providing disclosures related to appraisals and valuations, complying with data collection for loans to minority-owned and women-owned businesses as per the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and not discriminating in any aspect of a credit transaction based on prohibited factors.

62,62,63,reg b,0081b8ac5b1fad77,How does the flexibility for financial institutions to design their own procedures impact the collection of applicant-provided data in the lending process?,"The flexibility for financial institutions to design their own procedures allows them to establish practices that align with their specific lending model and product offerings. This flexibility enables financial institutions to determine the timing and manner in which they collect applicant-provided data, ensuring that their procedures are tailored to best suit their operations. As long as these procedures are reasonably designed to gather the required applicant-provided data as outlined in the regulations, financial institutions have the latitude to create processes that work effectively within their business framework.","Reliance on information provided by an applicant or appropriate third-party sources. A financial institution may rely on
statements made by an applicant (whether made in writing or orally) or information provided by an applicant when
compiling and reporting data pursuant to subpart B of this part for applicant-provided data; the financial institution is not
required to verify those statements or that information. However, if the financial institution does verify applicant statements
or information for its own business purposes, such as statements relating to gross annual revenue or time in business, the
financial institution reports the verified information. Depending on the circumstances and the financial institution's
procedures, certain applicant-provided data can be collected from appropriate third-party sources without a specific request
from the applicant, and such information may also be relied on. For example, gross annual revenue or NAICS code may be
collected from tax return documents; a financial institution may also collect an applicant's NAICS code using third-party
sources such as business information products. Applicant-provided data are the data that are or could be provided by the
applicant, including § 1002.107(a)(5) through (7) and (13) through (20). See comment 107(c)(1)-3. In regard to restrictions

1. Procedures. The term “procedures” refers to the actual practices followed by a financial institution as well as its stated
procedures. For example, if a financial institution's stated procedure is to collect applicant-provided data on or with a paper
application form, but employees encourage applicants to skip the page that asks whether the applicant is a minority-owned
business, a women-owned business, or an LGBTQI+-owned business under § 1002.107(a)(18), the financial institution's
procedures are not reasonably designed to obtain a response.
2. Latitude to design procedures.

For example, if a financial institution's stated procedure is to collect applicant-provided data on or with a paper
application form, but employees encourage applicants to skip the page that asks whether the applicant is a minority-owned
business, a women-owned business, or an LGBTQI+-owned business under § 1002.107(a)(18), the financial institution's
procedures are not reasonably designed to obtain a response.
2. Latitude to design procedures. A financial institution has flexibility to establish procedures concerning the timing and
manner in which it collects applicant-provided data that work best for its particular lending model and product offerings,
provided those procedures are reasonably designed to collect the applicant-provided data in § 1002.107(a), as required
pursuant to § 1002.107(c)(1), and where applicable comply with the minimum requirements set forth in § 1002.107(c)(2).
3. Applicant-provided data. Applicant-provided data are the data that are or could be provided by the applicant, including §
1002.107(a)(5) (credit type), § 1002.107(a)(6) (credit purpose), § 1002.107(a)(7) (amount applied for), § 1002.107(a)(13)
(address or location for purposes of determining census tract), § 1002.107(a)(14) (gross annual revenue), § 1002.107(a)
(15) (NAICS code, or information about the business such that the financial institution can determine the applicant's NAICS
code), § 1002.107(a)(16) (number of workers), § 1002.107(a)(17) (time in business), § 1002.107(a)(18) (minority-owned
business status, women-owned business status, and LGBTQI+-owned business status), § 1002.107(a)(19) (ethnicity, race,
and sex of the applicant's principal owners), and § 1002.107(a)(20) (number of principal owners).",1,True,,How does the flexibility for financial institutions to design their own procedures impact the collection of applicant-provided data in the lending process?,"The flexibility for financial institutions to design their own procedures can impact the collection of applicant-provided data in the lending process by influencing how the institutions structure their underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards. This flexibility allows institutions to determine the extent and nature of information required from applicants, which can affect the data collected during the lending process. Additionally, the discretion given to institutions in setting credit terms and conditions may influence the type and amount of applicant-provided data that is considered in the decision-making process.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Refer to Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations
to Streamline the Examination in the Appendix for
additional details.
Scoping may disclose the existence of circumstances —
such as the use of credit scoring or a large volume of
residential lending — which, under an agency’s policy, call
for the use of regression analysis or other statistical methods
of identifying potential discrimination with respect to one or
more loan products. Where that is the case, the agency’s
specialized procedures should be employed for such loan
products rather than the procedures set forth below.
Setting the intensity of an examination means determining the
breadth and depth of the analysis that will be conducted on the
selected loan product(s). This process entails a more involved
analysis of the institution’s compliance risk management
processes, particularly as it relates to selected products, to
reach an informed decision regarding how large a sample of
files to review in any transactional analyses performed and
whether certain aspects of the credit process deserve
heightened scrutiny.
Part I of these procedures provides guidance on establishing
the scope of the examination. Part II (Compliance
Management Review) provides guidance on determining the
intensity of the examination. There is naturally some
interdependence between these two phases. Ultimately the
scope and intensity of the examination will determine the
record of performance that serves as the foundation for
agency conclusions about institutional compliance with fair
lending obligations. The examiner should employ these
procedures to arrive at a well-reasoned and practical
conclusion about how to conduct a particular institution’s
examination of fair lending performance.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.5
In certain cases where an agency already possesses
information which provides examiners with guidance on
priorities and risks for planning an upcoming examination,
such information may expedite the scoping process and make
it unnecessary to carry out all of the steps below. For
example, the report of the previous fair lending examination
may have included recommendations for the focus of the next
examination. However, examiners should validate that the
institution’s operational structure, product offerings, policies,
and risks have not changed since the prior examination before
condensing the scoping process.
The scoping process can be performed either off-site, onsite, or
both, depending on whatever is determined appropriate and
feasible. In the interest of minimizing burdens on both the
examination team and the institution, requests for information
from the institution should be carefully thought out so as to
include only the information that will clearly be useful in the
examination process. Finally, any off-site information requests
should be made sufficiently in advance of the on-site schedule
to permit institutions adequate time to assemble necessary
information and provide it to the examination team in a timely
fashion. (See “Potential Scoping Information” in the
Appendix for guidance on additional information that the
examiner might wish to consider including in a request).
Examiners should focus the examination based on:
• An understanding of the credit operations
of the institution;
• The risk that discriminatory conduct may
occur in each area of those operations; and
• The feasibility of developing a factually
reliable record of an institution’s
performance and fair lending compliance in
each area of those operations.
Understanding Credit Operations
Before evaluating the potential for discriminatory conduct,
the examiner should review sufficient information about the
institution and its market to understand the credit operations
of the institution and the representation of prohibited basis
group residents within the markets where the institution does
business. The level of detail to be obtained at this stage
should be sufficient to identify whether any of the risk
factors in the steps below are present. Relevant background
information includes:
• The types and terms of credit products offered,
differentiating among broad categories of credit such as
residential, consumer, or commercial, as well as product
variations within such categories (fixed vs. variable, etc.).
• Whether the institution has a special purpose credit
program, or other program that is specifically designed to
assist certain underserved populations.
• The volume of, or growth in, lending for each of the
credit products offered.
• The demographics (i.e., race, national origin, etc.) of
the credit markets in which the institution is doing
business.
• The institution’s organization of its credit decisionmaking process, including identification of the
delegation of separate lending authorities and the extent
to which discretion in pricing or setting credit terms and
conditions is delegated to various levels of managers,
employees or independent brokers or dealers.
• The institution’s loan officer or broker
compensation program.
• The types of relevant documentation/data that are
available for various loan products and what is the
relative quantity, quality and accessibility of such
information (i.e., for which loan product(s) will the
information available be most likely to support a sound
and reliable fair lending analysis).
• The extent to which information requests can be
readily organized and coordinated with other
compliance examination components to reduce undue
burden on the institution. (Do not request more
information than the exam team can be expected to
utilize during the anticipated course of the
examination.)
In thinking about an institution’s credit markets, the
examiner should recognize that these markets may or may
not coincide with an institution’s Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA) assessment area(s). Where appropriate, the
examiner should review the demographics for a broader
geographic area than the assessment area.
Where an institution has multiple underwriting or loan
processing centers or subsidiaries, each with fully
independent credit-granting authority, consider evaluating
each center and/or subsidiary separately, provided a
sufficient number of loans exist to support a meaningful
analysis. In determining the scope of the examination for
such institutions, examiners should consider whether:
• Subsidiaries should be examined. The agencies will hold
a financial institution responsible for violations by its
direct subsidiaries, but not typically for those by its
affiliates (unless the affiliate has acted as the agent for the
institution or the violation by the affiliate was known or
should have been known to the institution before it
became involved in the transaction or purchased the
affiliate’s loans). When seeking to determine an
institution’s relationship with affiliates that are not
supervised financial institutions, limit the inquiry to what
can be learned in the institution and do not contact the

affiliate without prior consultation with agency staff.
• The underwriting standards and procedures used in the
entity being reviewed are used in related entities not
scheduled for the planned examination. ",How does the flexibility for financial institutions to design their own procedures impact the collection of applicant-provided data in the lending process?,"The flexibility for financial institutions to design their own procedures can impact the collection of applicant-provided data in the lending process by influencing how the institutions structure their underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.

Additionally, it can affect how institutions handle overrides, exceptions, and the overall validation of factors considered in credit scoring systems.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.

and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Refer to Using Self-Tests and Self-Evaluations
to Streamline the Examination in the Appendix for
additional details.
Scoping may disclose the existence of circumstances —
such as the use of credit scoring or a large volume of
residential lending — which, under an agency’s policy, call
for the use of regression analysis or other statistical methods
of identifying potential discrimination with respect to one or
more loan products. Where that is the case, the agency’s
specialized procedures should be employed for such loan
products rather than the procedures set forth below.
Setting the intensity of an examination means determining the
breadth and depth of the analysis that will be conducted on the
selected loan product(s). This process entails a more involved
analysis of the institution’s compliance risk management
processes, particularly as it relates to selected products, to
reach an informed decision regarding how large a sample of
files to review in any transactional analyses performed and
whether certain aspects of the credit process deserve
heightened scrutiny.
Part I of these procedures provides guidance on establishing
the scope of the examination. Part II (Compliance
Management Review) provides guidance on determining the
intensity of the examination. There is naturally some
interdependence between these two phases. Ultimately the
scope and intensity of the examination will determine the
record of performance that serves as the foundation for
agency conclusions about institutional compliance with fair
lending obligations. The examiner should employ these
procedures to arrive at a well-reasoned and practical
conclusion about how to conduct a particular institution’s
examination of fair lending performance.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.5
In certain cases where an agency already possesses
information which provides examiners with guidance on
priorities and risks for planning an upcoming examination,
such information may expedite the scoping process and make
it unnecessary to carry out all of the steps below. For
example, the report of the previous fair lending examination
may have included recommendations for the focus of the next
examination. However, examiners should validate that the
institution’s operational structure, product offerings, policies,
and risks have not changed since the prior examination before
condensing the scoping process.
The scoping process can be performed either off-site, onsite, or
both, depending on whatever is determined appropriate and
feasible. In the interest of minimizing burdens on both the
examination team and the institution, requests for information
from the institution should be carefully thought out so as to
include only the information that will clearly be useful in the
examination process. Finally, any off-site information requests
should be made sufficiently in advance of the on-site schedule
to permit institutions adequate time to assemble necessary
information and provide it to the examination team in a timely
fashion. (See “Potential Scoping Information” in the
Appendix for guidance on additional information that the
examiner might wish to consider including in a request).
Examiners should focus the examination based on:
• An understanding of the credit operations
of the institution;
• The risk that discriminatory conduct may
occur in each area of those operations; and
• The feasibility of developing a factually
reliable record of an institution’s
performance and fair lending compliance in
each area of those operations.
Understanding Credit Operations
Before evaluating the potential for discriminatory conduct,
the examiner should review sufficient information about the
institution and its market to understand the credit operations
of the institution and the representation of prohibited basis
group residents within the markets where the institution does
business. The level of detail to be obtained at this stage
should be sufficient to identify whether any of the risk
factors in the steps below are present. Relevant background
information includes:
• The types and terms of credit products offered,
differentiating among broad categories of credit such as
residential, consumer, or commercial, as well as product
variations within such categories (fixed vs. variable, etc.).
• Whether the institution has a special purpose credit
program, or other program that is specifically designed to
assist certain underserved populations.
• The volume of, or growth in, lending for each of the
credit products offered.
• The demographics (i.e., race, national origin, etc.) of
the credit markets in which the institution is doing
business.
• The institution’s organization of its credit decisionmaking process, including identification of the
delegation of separate lending authorities and the extent
to which discretion in pricing or setting credit terms and
conditions is delegated to various levels of managers,
employees or independent brokers or dealers.
• The institution’s loan officer or broker
compensation program.
• The types of relevant documentation/data that are
available for various loan products and what is the
relative quantity, quality and accessibility of such
information (i.e., for which loan product(s) will the
information available be most likely to support a sound
and reliable fair lending analysis).
• The extent to which information requests can be
readily organized and coordinated with other
compliance examination components to reduce undue
burden on the institution. (Do not request more
information than the exam team can be expected to
utilize during the anticipated course of the
examination.)
In thinking about an institution’s credit markets, the
examiner should recognize that these markets may or may
not coincide with an institution’s Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA) assessment area(s). Where appropriate, the
examiner should review the demographics for a broader
geographic area than the assessment area.
Where an institution has multiple underwriting or loan
processing centers or subsidiaries, each with fully
independent credit-granting authority, consider evaluating
each center and/or subsidiary separately, provided a
sufficient number of loans exist to support a meaningful
analysis. In determining the scope of the examination for
such institutions, examiners should consider whether:
• Subsidiaries should be examined. The agencies will hold
a financial institution responsible for violations by its
direct subsidiaries, but not typically for those by its
affiliates (unless the affiliate has acted as the agent for the
institution or the violation by the affiliate was known or
should have been known to the institution before it
became involved in the transaction or purchased the
affiliate’s loans). When seeking to determine an
institution’s relationship with affiliates that are not
supervised financial institutions, limit the inquiry to what
can be learned in the institution and do not contact the 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.6 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
affiliate without prior consultation with agency staff.
• The underwriting standards and procedures used in the
entity being reviewed are used in related entities not
scheduled for the planned examination. ",How does the flexibility for financial institutions to design their own procedures impact the collection of applicant-provided data in the lending process?,"The flexibility for financial institutions to design their own procedures can impact the collection of applicant-provided data in the lending process by influencing how institutions structure their underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards. This flexibility allows institutions to establish their own criteria for collecting and analyzing applicant-provided data, which can vary based on the institution's specific lending operations and risk management processes.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.

2. Credit card account, not private-label. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(5)(i) by reporting the credit product
as a “credit card account, not private-label” when the product is a business-purpose open-end credit account that is not
private label and that may be accessed from time to time by a card, plate, or other single credit device to obtain credit,

generally paid in full each billing period, as well as hybrid prepaid-credit cards. A financial institution reports multiple credit
card account, not private-label applications requested at one time using the guidance in comment 103(a)-7.
3. Private-label credit card account. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(5)(i) by reporting the credit product as
a “private-label credit card account” when the product is a business-purpose open-end private-label credit account that
otherwise meets the description of a credit card account in comment 107(a)(5)-2. A private-label credit card account is a
credit card account that can only be used to acquire goods or services provided by one business (for example, a specific
merchant, retailer, independent dealer, or manufacturer) or a small group of related businesses. A co-branded or other card
that can also be used for purchases at unrelated businesses is not a private-label credit card. A financial institution reports
multiple private-label credit card account applications requested at one time in the same manner as credit card account, not
private-label applications, using the guidance in comment 103(a)-7.
4. Credit product not provided by the applicant and otherwise undetermined. Pursuant to § 1002.107(c), a financial institution is

because the applicant does not indicate what credit product it seeks and the application is denied, withdrawn, or closed for
incompleteness before a credit product is identified, the financial institution reports that the credit product is “not provided
by applicant and otherwise undetermined.”
5. Reporting credit product involving counteroffers. If a financial institution presents a counteroffer for a different credit
product than the product the applicant had initially requested, and the applicant does not agree to proceed with the
counteroffer, the financial institution reports the application for the original credit product as denied pursuant to §
1002.107(a)(9).",1,True,,"How does a financial institution comply with reporting a credit product as 'credit card account, not private-label' according to § 1002.107(a)(5)(i)?","A financial institution complies with reporting a credit product as 'credit card account, not private-label' according to § 1002.107(a)(5)(i) by accurately categorizing the credit product based on its characteristics and terms.

on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek

information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","I. Credit Scoring.
If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.

","How does a financial institution comply with reporting a credit product as 'credit card account, not private-label' according to § 1002.107(a)(5)(i)?","A financial institution complies with reporting a credit product as 'credit card account, not private-label' according to § 1002.107(a)(5)(i) by accurately categorizing the credit product in its reporting systems based on the specific criteria outlined in the regulation. This involves distinguishing between different types of credit products and correctly identifying a credit card account that is not a private-label card. By following the guidelines provided in the regulation, the institution ensures that the credit product is reported correctly for regulatory compliance purposes.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size

f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any

control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","I. Credit Scoring.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24

This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,

Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff

The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA

application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of

• Learn how the institution identifies which consumers
to contact, and whether the institution sets any
parameters on how the list of consumers is compiled.
Step 2. ",correct,"The reference text provided clearly states that Regulation B is covered in Part 1002 of the document. The specific section mentioned in the reference text is § 1002.2, which falls under Subpart A General 1002.1 – 1002.16. Therefore, the answer correctly identifies that Regulation B is covered in Part 1002 of the document based on the reference text provided.",
65,65,66,reg b,b97a2e58ac746d7a,Provide an example scenario where errors in reporting loan amount and gross annual income would be covered by the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b).,"Errors in reporting loan amount and gross annual income would be covered by the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b) if a financial institution submitted a small business lending application register containing 105 applications and made two errors in reporting loan amount and two errors reporting gross annual income. In this scenario, all of these errors would be considered bona fide errors and would not constitute a violation of the Act or the relevant section.","The thresholds in column C of the Threshold Table reflect the number of unintentional errors a financial institution may make within a
particular data field (e.g., the credit product data field within the credit type data point or the ethnicity data field for a particular
principal owner within the ethnicity, race, and sex of principal owners data point) in a small business lending application register that
would be deemed bona fide errors for purposes of § 1002.112(b).
For instance, a financial institution that submitted a small business lending application register containing 105 applications would be
subject to a threshold of three errors per data field. If the financial institution had made two errors in reporting loan amount and two
errors reporting gross annual income, all of these errors would be covered by the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b) and
would not constitute a violation of the Act or this part. If the same financial institution had made four errors in reporting loan amount
and two errors reporting gross annual income, the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b) would not apply to the four loan amount
errors but would still apply to the two gross annual income errors.
Even when the number of errors in a particular data field do not equal or exceed the threshold in column C, if either there is a
reasonable basis to believe that errors in that field were intentional or there is evidence that the financial institution did not maintain
procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors, then the errors are not bona fide errors under § 1002.112(b).
For purposes of determining bona fide errors under § 1002.112(b), the term “data field” generally refers to individual fields. Some data
fields may allow for more than one response. For example, with respect to information on the ethnicity or race of an applicant's
principal owners, a data field may identify more than one race or more than one ethnicity for a given person. If one or more of the
ethnicities or races identified in a data field are erroneous, they count as one (and only one) error for that data field.

(c) Limitation on personally identifiable information in certain records retained under this section. In reporting a small business
lending application register pursuant to § 1002.109, maintaining the register pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and
maintaining a separate record of information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, a financial institution shall not
include any name, specific address, telephone number, email address, or any other personally identifiable information
concerning any individual who is, or is connected with, an applicant, other than as required pursuant to § 1002.107 or
paragraph (b) of this section.
(a) Administrative enforcement and civil liability. A violation of section 704B of the Act or this subpart is subject to
administrative sanctions and civil liability as provided in sections 704 (15 U.S.C. 1691c) and 706 (15 U.S.C. 1691e) of the
Act, where applicable.
(b) Bona fide errors. A bona fide error in compiling, maintaining, or reporting data with respect to a covered application is one
that was unintentional and occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such an error. A
bona fide error is not a violation of the Act or this subpart. A financial institution is presumed to maintain procedures
reasonably adapted to avoid such errors with respect to a given data field if the number of errors found in a random sample
of the financial institution's submission for the data field does not equal or exceed a threshold specified by the Bureau for
this purpose in appendix F to this part. However, an error is not a bona fide error if either there is a reasonable basis to
believe the error was intentional or there is evidence that the financial institution does not or has not maintained procedures
reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.
(c) Safe harbors —
(1) Incorrect entry for application date. A financial institution does not violate the Act or this subpart if it reports on its
small business lending application register an application date that is within three business days of the actual
application date pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(2).
(2) Incorrect entry for census tract.",1,True,,Provide an example scenario where errors in reporting loan amount and gross annual income would be covered by the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b).,"An example scenario where errors in reporting loan amount and gross annual income would be covered by the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b) is when a lender mistakenly inputs incorrect information from a loan application into their system due to a clerical error. For instance, if a loan officer accidentally types in the wrong loan amount or gross annual income for an applicant, resulting in discrepancies in the reported figures, this could be considered a bona fide error under the provision.","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.10 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low

R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).

Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

Examples of activities that do not constitute being involved in making a determination concerning a covered application

A. Developing policies and procedures, designing or programming computer or other systems, or conducting
marketing.
B. Discussing credit products, loan terms, or loan requirements with a small business before it submits a covered

minor or clerical matter during the application process, such as suggesting or selecting a time for an
appointment with an applicant.
E. Gathering information (including information collected pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) or (19)) and forwarding the
information or a covered application to other individuals or entities.
F. Reviewing previously collected data to determine if it can be reused for a later covered application pursuant to §
1002.107(d).
iii. Examples of activities that constitute being involved in making a determination concerning a covered application from a
small business. The following are examples of activities (done individually or as part of a group) that constitute being
involved in making a determination concerning a covered application:
A. Making or participating in a decision to approve or deny a specific covered application. This includes, but is not
limited to, making or participating in a decision that an applicant does not satisfy one or more of the
requirements for the covered credit transaction for which it has applied.
B. Making or participating in a decision regarding the reason(s) for denial of a covered application.
C. Making or participating in a decision that a guarantor or collateral is required in order to approve a specific
covered application.
D. Making or participating in a decision regarding the credit amount or credit limit that will be approved for a specific
covered application.
E. Making or participating in a decision to set one or more of the other terms that will be offered for a specific
covered credit transaction. This includes, but is not limited to, making or participating in a decision regarding the
interest rate, the loan term, or the payment schedule that will be offered for a specific covered credit transaction.

An employee or officer is not involved in making a
determination concerning a covered application if the employee or officer is only involved in making a decision that
affects covered applications generally, or if the employee or officer only interacts with small businesses prior to them
becoming applicants or submitting an application. An employee or officer may be participating in a determination
concerning a covered application even if the employee or officer is not the ultimate decision maker or the sole decision
maker. For example, an employee participates in a determination concerning a covered application if the employee
recommends that another employee or officer approve or deny the application. Similarly, an employee or officer
participates in a determination concerning a covered application if the employee or officer is part of a larger group,
such as a committee, that makes a determination concerning a covered application. For example, an employee
participates in a decision if the employee is a member of a committee that approves the terms offered to an applicant
for a covered application. This is true even if the employee does not support the committee's ultimate decision
regarding the terms offered. Conversely, an employee or officer does not participate in a determination concerning a
covered application if the employee or officer only performs ministerial functions for the committee, such as recording
the minutes, or if the committee does not make a determination concerning a specific covered application.

c. Marketing. A clear exclusion of the suspected redlining
area from the institution’s marketing of residential loan

affirmative acts to include or exclude areas. Disparities in

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Explain the reporting obligations of Financial Institution A, B, C, and D in the scenario where the applicant does not accept the credit terms offered.","Financial Institution A, B, C, and D are required to document the policies, conditions, or criteria for determining how referrals are made and choices presented to applicants who do not accept the credit terms offered. They must obtain information on alternatives offered by subsidiaries/affiliates and the institution itself, provide a written summary of discussions with loan personnel and managers, document the volume of referrals made, resolve any discrepancies between information found and obtained, and identify policies and procedures for referring applicants to other internal lending channels or subsidiaries/affiliates. Additionally, they need to determine how referral decisions are made and documented, assess the extent of individual loan personnel discretion, ensure adherence to stated policies, and conduct a comparative analysis to determine if discretion has been exercised in a nondiscriminatory manner.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting

information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not

• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit

• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a

Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s

• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer

originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","Explain the reporting obligations of Financial Institution A, B, C, and D in the scenario where the applicant does not accept the credit terms offered.","Financial Institution A, B, C, and D are required to have policies and procedures in place for referring applicants who do not meet their criteria to other internal lending channels, subsidiaries, or affiliates. They must offer alternative products or features to applicants who do not meet their criteria. The institutions should document all discussions with loan personnel and managers, including any discrepancies between information found in documents and information obtained in discussions. Additionally, they need to resolve any differences by conducting follow-up interviews. Financial incentives related to referrals and products should be monitored, and the institutions must ensure that their stated policies and criteria are adhered to by individual decision-makers. If there are disparities in treatment between control group and prohibited basis group applicants, these must be documented and discussed with management.","Examples of terms and features include
prepayment penalties and escrow requirements. The
distinction between a product, term, and feature may
vary institution to institution. For example, some
institutions may consider “stated income” a feature,
whiles others may consider that a distinct product.
b. Pricing or other costs applicable to the product and the
alternative product(s), including interest rates, points,
and all fees.
Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.

This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.

The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;

• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or

apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide

the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.

",correct,"The answer correctly summarizes the general rules regarding discrimination in a credit transaction according to Regulation B under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. It mentions the specific factors on which discrimination is prohibited, the acts and practices that are outlined, and the purpose of the regulation. The answer aligns with the information provided in the reference text.",
69,69,70,reg b,3e5c32fdcecf1931,What are the key factors that adversely affected the applicant's credit score?,"Insufficient bank references, type of occupation, insufficient credit experience, and number of recent inquiries on credit bureau report were the key factors that adversely affected the applicant's credit score.","A creditor need not describe how or why a factor adversely affected an applicant. For example, the
notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.”
4. Credit scoring system. If a creditor bases the denial or other adverse action on a credit scoring system, the reasons
disclosed must relate only to those factors actually scored in the system. Moreover, no factor that was a principal reason
for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure. The creditor must disclose the actual reasons for denial (for example,
“age of automobile”) even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.
5. Credit scoring —method for selecting reasons. The regulation does not require that any one method be used for selecting
reasons for a credit denial or other adverse action that is based on a credit scoring system. Various methods will meet the
requirements of the regulation. One method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the
average score for each of those factors achieved by applicants whose total score was at or slightly above the minimum
passing score. Another method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average
score for each of those factors achieved by all applicants. These average scores could be calculated during the
development or use of the system. Any other method that produces results substantially similar to either of these methods
is also acceptable under the regulation.
6. Judgmental system. If a creditor uses a judgmental system, the reasons for the denial or other adverse action must relate to
those factors in the applicant's record actually reviewed by the person making the decision.
7. Combined credit scoring and judgmental system. If a creditor denies an application based on a credit evaluation system that
employs both credit scoring and judgmental components, the reasons for the denial must come from the component of the
system that the applicant failed. For example, if a creditor initially credit scores an application and denies the credit request
as a result of that scoring, the reasons disclosed to the applicant must relate to the factors scored in the system.

incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.

spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.

a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.10 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.

branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low

R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","I. Credit Scoring.
If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
J. Disparate Impact Issues.
",What are the key factors that adversely affected the applicant's credit score?,"Factors that adversely affected the applicant's credit score include a substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/incomplete applications from prohibited basis group applicants compared to other applicants, vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria, lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to underwriting criteria, lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons for exceptions to standard underwriting criteria, relatively high percentages of exceptions to underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs, and potential disparate treatment in pricing such as financial incentives for loan officers to charge higher prices and disparities in pricing for applicants with different prohibited basis characteristics.","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.

P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.

 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).

applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant

points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.

applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.

credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the

",incorrect,"The answer provided does not directly address the key factors that adversely affected the applicant's credit score as mentioned in the reference text. The reference text specifies factors related to credit scoring systems, judgmental systems, and combined systems, while the answer focuses on vague underwriting criteria, lack of clear guidance, discriminatory practices, and other factors not mentioned in the reference.",
70,70,71,reg b,8d12223ebfa8b92b,What specific information should a creditor retain for 25 months after making an offer of credit to potential customers?,"The specific information that a creditor should retain for 25 months after making an offer of credit to potential customers includes the text of any prescreened solicitation, the list of criteria used to select potential recipients of the solicitation, and any correspondence related to complaints (formal or informal) about the solicitation.","The creditor shall retain the information until final
disposition of the matter, unless an earlier time is allowed by order of the agency or court.
(5) Special rule for certain business credit applications. With regard to a business that had gross revenues in excess of $1
million in its preceding fiscal year, or an extension of trade credit, credit incident to a factoring agreement, or other
similar types of business credit, the creditor shall retain records for at least 60 days, except as otherwise provided for
in subpart B, after notifying the applicant of the action taken. If within that time period the applicant requests in writing
the reasons for adverse action or that records be retained, the creditor shall retain records for 12 months.
(6) Self-tests. For 25 months after a self-test (as defined in § 1002.15) has been completed, the creditor shall retain all
written or recorded information about the self-test. A creditor shall retain information beyond 25 months if it has
actual notice that it is under investigation or is subject to an enforcement proceeding for an alleged violation, or if it
has been served with notice of a civil action. In such cases, the creditor shall retain the information until final
disposition of the matter, unless an earlier time is allowed by the appropriate agency or court order.
(7) Prescreened solicitations. For 25 months after the date on which an offer of credit is made to potential customers (12
months for business credit, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section or otherwise provided for in subpart
B), the creditor shall retain in original form or a copy thereof:
(i) The text of any prescreened solicitation;
(ii) The list of criteria the creditor used to select potential recipients of the solicitation; and
(iii) Any correspondence related to complaints (formal or informal) about the solicitation.
(a) Information to be requested.

In most cases, the 25-month retention period for applications runs from the date a
notification is sent to the applicant granting or denying the credit requested. In certain transactions, a creditor is not
obligated to provide a notice of the action taken. (See, for example, comment 9-2.) In such cases, the 25-month requirement
runs from the date of application, as when:
i. An application is withdrawn by the applicant.
ii. An application is submitted to more than one creditor on behalf of the applicant, and the application is approved by
one of the other creditors.
1. The rule requires all written or recorded information about a self-test to be retained for 25 months after a self-test
has been completed. For this purpose, a self-test is completed after the creditor has obtained the results and
made a determination about what corrective action, if any, is appropriate. Creditors are required to retain
information about the scope of the self-test, the methodology used and time period covered by the self-test, the
report or results of the self-test including any analysis or conclusions, and any corrective action taken in response
to the self-test.
2. List of criteria. A creditor must retain the list of criteria used to select potential recipients. This includes the
criteria used by the creditor both to determine the potential recipients of the particular solicitation and to
determine who will actually be offered credit.
3. Correspondence. A creditor may retain correspondence relating to consumers' complaints about prescreened
solicitations in any manner that is reasonably accessible and is understandable to examiners. There is no
requirement to establish a separate database or set of files for such correspondence, or to match consumer
complaints with specific solicitation programs.

A. A creditor provides information only on “subprime” and similar products to minority applicants who request
information about the creditor's mortgage products, but provides information on a wider variety of mortgage
products to similarly situated nonminority applicants.
B. A creditor provides more comprehensive information to men than to similarly situated women.
C. A creditor requires a minority applicant to provide greater documentation to obtain a loan than a similarly situated
nonminority applicant.
D. A creditor waives or relaxes credit standards for a nonminority applicant but not for a similarly situated minority

1. Prospective applicants. Generally, the regulation's protections apply only to persons who have requested or received an
extension of credit. In keeping with the purpose of the Act—to promote the availability of credit on a nondiscriminatory
basis—§ 1002.4(b) covers acts or practices directed at prospective applicants that could discourage a reasonable person,
on a prohibited basis, from applying for credit. Practices prohibited by this section include:
i. A statement that the applicant should not bother to apply, after the applicant states that he is retired.
ii. The use of words, symbols, models or other forms of communication in advertising that express, imply, or suggest a
discriminatory preference or a policy of exclusion in violation of the Act.
iii. The use of interview scripts that discourage applications on a prohibited basis.
2. Affirmative advertising. A creditor may affirmatively solicit or encourage members of traditionally disadvantaged groups to
apply for credit, especially groups that might not normally seek credit from that creditor.

Unlawful discriminatory practices in relation to credit on the basis of race, creed, color,

ii. Article 15, section 296a(1)(c). Unlawful discriminatory practice to make any record or inquiry based on race, creed,

creditor from requesting and considering information regarding the particular characteristics (for example, race,
national origin, or sex) required for eligibility for special-purpose credit programs.

A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,

Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable

Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","According to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, what are the prohibited bases for discriminating against credit applicants?","The prohibited bases for discriminating against credit applicants according to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act are race or color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), the applicant’s receipt of income derived from any public assistance program, or the applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan

30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.1
Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
",correct,"The answer provided correctly lists the prohibited bases for discriminating against credit applicants according to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. It includes race or color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), the applicant’s receipt of income derived from any public assistance program, and the applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. These are all the prohibited bases mentioned in the reference text.",

They must comply with the general rule prohibiting discrimination (§ 1002.4(a) ) and the general rule against discouraging applications (§ 1002.4(b)).","2. Examples.
i. Disparate treatment would exist, for example, in the following situations:
A. A creditor provides information only on “subprime” and similar products to minority applicants who request
information about the creditor's mortgage products, but provides information on a wider variety of mortgage
products to similarly situated nonminority applicants.
B. A creditor provides more comprehensive information to men than to similarly situated women.
C. A creditor requires a minority applicant to provide greater documentation to obtain a loan than a similarly situated
nonminority applicant.
D. A creditor waives or relaxes credit standards for a nonminority applicant but not for a similarly situated minority
applicant.
ii. Treating applicants differently on a prohibited basis is unlawful if the creditor lacks a legitimate nondiscriminatory
reason for its action, or if the asserted reason is found to be a pretext for discrimination.

5(a) General rules.
Paragraph 5(a)(1).
5(a)(2) Required Collection of Information
1. Prospective applicants. Generally, the regulation's protections apply only to persons who have requested or received an
extension of credit. In keeping with the purpose of the Act—to promote the availability of credit on a nondiscriminatory
basis—§ 1002.4(b) covers acts or practices directed at prospective applicants that could discourage a reasonable person,
on a prohibited basis, from applying for credit. Practices prohibited by this section include:
i. A statement that the applicant should not bother to apply, after the applicant states that he is retired.
ii. The use of words, symbols, models or other forms of communication in advertising that express, imply, or suggest a
discriminatory preference or a policy of exclusion in violation of the Act.
iii. The use of interview scripts that discourage applications on a prohibited basis.
2. Affirmative advertising. A creditor may affirmatively solicit or encourage members of traditionally disadvantaged groups to
apply for credit, especially groups that might not normally seek credit from that creditor.

2. Referrals to creditors. For certain purposes, the term creditor includes persons such as real estate brokers, automobile
dealers, home builders, and home-improvement contractors who do not participate in credit decisions but who only accept
applications and refer applicants to creditors, or select or offer to select creditors to whom credit requests can be made.
These persons must comply with § 1002.4(a), the general rule prohibiting discrimination, and with § 1002.4(b), the general
rule against discouraging applications.

2(w) Open-end credit.
2(z) Prohibited basis.
1. Persons associated with applicant. As used in this part, prohibited basis refers not only to characteristics—the race, color, religion,
national origin, sex, marital status, or age—of an applicant (or officers of an applicant in the case of a corporation) but also to the
characteristics of individuals with whom an applicant is affiliated or with whom the applicant associates. This means, for example,
that under the general rule stated in § 1002.4(a), a creditor may not discriminate against an applicant because of that person's
personal or business dealings with members of a certain religion, because of the national origin of any persons associated with the
extension of credit (such as the tenants in the apartment complex being financed), or because of the race of other residents in the
neighborhood where the property offered as collateral is located.
Section 1002.3—Limited Exceptions for Certain Classes of Transactions
1. Purpose of definition. The definition under §§ 1002.2(p)(1)(i) through (iv) sets the criteria that a credit system must meet in
order to use age as a predictive factor. Credit systems that do not meet these criteria are judgmental systems and may
consider age only for the purpose of determining a “pertinent element of creditworthiness.
” (Both types of systems may
favor an elderly applicant. See § 1002.6(b)(2).)
2. Periodic revalidation. The regulation does not specify how often credit scoring systems must be revalidated.",1,True,,"Who are considered as creditors for certain purposes under the regulation, and what rules must they comply with regarding discrimination and discouraging applications?","Creditors for certain purposes under the regulation are lenders. They must comply with rules that prohibit discrimination based on specific factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, and other protected characteristics. Additionally, creditors must not discourage or selectively encourage applicants inquiring about or applying for credit, refuse to extend credit, or use different standards in determining credit extension. They are also required not to vary the terms of credit offered based on prohibited factors.","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","Who are considered as creditors for certain purposes under the regulation, and what rules must they comply with regarding discrimination and discouraging applications?","Creditors for certain purposes under the regulation are lenders. They must comply with rules that prohibit discrimination based on specific factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, and other protected characteristics. Additionally, creditors are required to avoid discouraging or selectively encouraging applicants inquiring about or applying for credit, as well as refrain from using different standards in determining credit extension, varying the terms of credit offered, or failing to provide equal information or services during the lending process.","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;

",correct,"The answer correctly identifies creditors for certain purposes under the regulation as lenders and mentions the rules they must comply with regarding discrimination and discouraging applications. It specifically mentions the prohibited factors for discrimination and the actions that creditors must not take, such as refusing to extend credit or using different standards based on prohibited factors. The answer aligns with the information provided in the reference text regarding the responsibilities and rules for creditors under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B).",
73,73,74,reg b,41a999179892b9b1,"In the scenario provided, what is the significance of the creditor waiting 30 days to provide a copy of the completed AVM report?","The significance of the creditor waiting 30 days to provide a copy of the completed AVM report is that it did not promptly provide the AVM report upon completion, as required by the regulations. This delay in providing the AVM report could be considered a violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B) guidelines, which emphasize the timely provision of valuation reports to applicants.","The applicant actually receives the valuation more
than three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the copy
of the AVM report promptly upon completion.
iv. Delay in sending an appraisal. On day 12 after receipt of the application, the creditor's underwriting department reviews
an appraisal and determines it is acceptable. Although the creditor has determined the appraisal is complete, the
creditor waits to provide a copy to the applicant until day 42, when the creditor schedules the consummation (or
account opening) to occur on day 50. The creditor has not provided the copy of the appraisal promptly upon
completion.
v. Delay in sending an AVM report while waiting for completion of a second valuation. The creditor receives an AVM report
on day 5 after application and completes its review of the AVM report the day it is received. The creditor also has
ordered an appraisal, but the initial version of the appraisal received by the creditor is found to be deficient and is sent
for review. The creditor waits 30 days to provide a copy of the completed AVM report, until the appraisal is completed
on day 35. The creditor then provides the applicant with copies of the AVM report and the revised appraisal. While the
appraisal report was provided promptly upon completion, the AVM report was not.

The applicant actually receives the copy more than three business days before the date of consummation
(or account opening). The creditor has provided the copy of the appraisal promptly upon completion.
ii. Sending a copy of a revised appraisal within a week after completion and with sufficient time before consummation (or
account opening for open-end credit). An appraisal is being revised, and the creditor does not receive the revised
appraisal until day 45 after the application, when the creditor immediately determines the revised appraisal is
acceptable. A week later, the creditor sends a copy of the revised appraisal to the applicant, and does not send a copy
of the initial appraisal to the applicant. The applicant actually receives the copy of the revised appraisal three business
days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the appraisal copy promptly
upon completion.
iii. Sending a copy of an AVM report within a week after its receipt and with sufficient time before consummation (or
account opening for open-end credit). The creditor receives an automated valuation model (AVM) report on day 5 after
receipt of the application and treats the AVM report as complete when it is received. On day 12 after receipt of the

74,74,75,reg b,7066026532730bbe,"Explain the reporting procedure if a financial institution does not receive a response regarding an applicant's minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses.","The financial institution reports that the applicant's business statuses were ""not provided by applicant"" if it does not receive a response regarding an applicant's minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses.","If the financial institution uses a web-based data collection form, the form should be on its own page.
6. Minority-owned, women-owned, and/or LGBTQI+-owned business statuses not provided by applicant. Pursuant to §
1002.107(c), a financial institution shall maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which
includes the applicant's minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses. However, if a financial
institution does not receive a response to the financial institution's inquiry pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18), the financial
institution reports that the applicant's business statuses were “not provided by applicant.
”
7. Applicant declines to provide information about minority-owned, women-owned, and/or LGBTQI+-owned business statuses. A
financial institution reports that the applicant responded that it did not wish to provide the information about an applicant's
minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses, if the applicant declines to provide the information
by selecting such a response option on a paper or electronic form (e.g., by selecting an answer option of “I do not wish to
provide this information” or similar). The financial institution also reports an applicant's refusal to provide such information
in this way, if the applicant orally declines to provide such information for a covered application taken by telephone or
another medium that does not involve providing any paper or electronic documents.
8. Conflicting responses provided by applicants. If the applicant both provides a substantive response to the financial
institution's inquiry regarding business status (that is, indicates that it is a minority-owned, women-owned, and/or LGBTQI+-
owned business, or checks “none apply” or similar) and also checks the box indicating “I do not wish to provide this
information” or similar, the financial institution reports the substantive response(s) provided by the applicant (rather than
reporting that the applicant declined to provide the information).
9. No verification of business statuses.

See the sample data collection form in appendix E to this part for sample language for providing this notice to
applicants. The financial institution must report the applicant's substantive response regarding each business status, that
the applicant declined to answer the inquiry (that is, selected an answer option of “I do not wish to provide this information”
or similar), or its failure to respond to the inquiry (that is,
“not provided by applicant”), as applicable.
2. Definitions. When inquiring about minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses (regardless of
whether the request is made on a paper form, electronically, or orally), the financial institution also must provide the
applicant with definitions of the terms “minority-owned business,
” “women-owned business,
” and “LGBTQI+-owned
business” as set forth in § 1002.102 (m), (s) and (l), respectively. The financial institution satisfies this requirement if it
provides the definitions as set forth in the sample data collection form in appendix E.
3. Combining questions. A financial institution may combine on the same paper or electronic data collection form the
questions regarding minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business status pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18)
with principal owners' ethnicity, race, and sex pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(19) and the applicant's number of principal owners
pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(20). See the sample data collection form in appendix E.
4. Notices. When requesting minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses from an applicant, a
financial institution must inform the applicant that the financial institution cannot discriminate on the basis of the
applicant's minority-owned, women-owned, or LGBTQI+-owned business statuses, or on whether the applicant provides its
minority-owned, women-owned, or LGBTQI+-owned business statuses. A financial institution must also inform the applicant
that Federal law requires it to ask for an applicant's minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses
to help ensure that all small business applicants for credit are treated fairly and that communities' small business credit
needs are being fulfilled.",1,True,,"Explain the reporting procedure if a financial institution does not receive a response regarding an applicant's minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses.","The reporting procedure if a financial institution does not receive a response regarding an applicant's minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses involves evaluating the maintenance or use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics of those involved with the business in approved or denied loan applications. This evaluation should be conducted as a potential violation of Regulation B.","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to

percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited

R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively

R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority

R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.

pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.

interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,

clear and objective criteria.

M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.

marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.

pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.

Recommending that another decision maker approve or deny a specific covered application, provide a specific
reason for denying a covered application, require a guarantor or collateral in order to approve a covered
application, approve a credit amount or credit limit for a covered credit transaction, set one or more other terms
for a covered credit transaction, make a counteroffer regarding a covered application, or set a specific term for
such a counteroffer.
2. Should have access.
i. General. A financial institution may determine that an employee or officer who is involved in making a determination
concerning a covered application from a small business should have access to information otherwise subject to the
prohibition in § 1002.108(b) if that employee or officer is assigned one or more job duties that may require the
employee or officer to collect, see, consider, refer to, or otherwise use information subject to the prohibition in §
1002.108(b). If the employee or officer might need to collect, see, consider, refer to, or use such information to perform
the employee's or officer's assigned job duties, the financial institution may determine that the employee or officer
should have access. For example, if a loan officer is involved in making a determination concerning a covered
application and that loan officer's job description or the financial institution's policies and procedures state that the
loan officer may need to collect information pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) or (19), the financial institution may
determine that the loan officer should have access.
ii. When a group of employees or officers should have access. A financial institution may determine that all employees or
officers with the same job description or assigned duties should have access for purposes of § 1002.108. For
example, if a job description, a policy, a procedure, or another document states that a loan officer may have to collect
or explain any part of a data collection form that includes the inquiries described in § 1002.107(a)(18) and (19), the
financial institution may determine that all employees and officers who have been assigned the position of loan officer
should have access for purposes of § 1002.108.
iii. Making a determination regarding who should have access.

ii. Examples of activities that do not constitute being involved in making a determination concerning a covered application
from a small business. The following are examples of activities that do not constitute being involved in making a
determination concerning a covered application:
A. Developing policies and procedures, designing or programming computer or other systems, or conducting
marketing.
B. Discussing credit products, loan terms, or loan requirements with a small business before it submits a covered
application.
C. Making or participating in a decision after the financial institution has taken final action on the covered
application, such as a decision about servicing or collecting a covered credit transaction.
D. Using a check box form to confirm whether an applicant has submitted all necessary documents or handling a
minor or clerical matter during the application process, such as suggesting or selecting a time for an
appointment with an applicant.
E. Gathering information (including information collected pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) or (19)) and forwarding the
information or a covered application to other individuals or entities.
F. Reviewing previously collected data to determine if it can be reused for a later covered application pursuant to §
1002.107(d).
iii. Examples of activities that constitute being involved in making a determination concerning a covered application from a
small business. The following are examples of activities (done individually or as part of a group) that constitute being
involved in making a determination concerning a covered application:
A. Making or participating in a decision to approve or deny a specific covered application. This includes, but is not
limited to, making or participating in a decision that an applicant does not satisfy one or more of the
requirements for the covered credit transaction for which it has applied.
B. Making or participating in a decision regarding the reason(s) for denial of a covered application.
C. Making or participating in a decision that a guarantor or collateral is required in order to approve a specific
covered application.
D. Making or participating in a decision regarding the credit amount or credit limit that will be approved for a specific
covered application.
E. Making or participating in a decision to set one or more of the other terms that will be offered for a specific
covered credit transaction. This includes, but is not limited to, making or participating in a decision regarding the
interest rate, the loan term, or the payment schedule that will be offered for a specific covered credit transaction.",1,True,,Define the terms 'involved in making any determination concerning a covered application from a small business' and 'should have access' as outlined in the context information.,"The term 'involved in making any determination concerning a covered application from a small business' refers to individuals who play a role in assessing or deciding on a loan application submitted by a small business. These individuals could include underwriters, loan officers, or any other personnel involved in the decision-making process related to small business loan applications.

The term 'should have access' means that examiners should be provided with the necessary information, documents, and resources to effectively evaluate and understand the institution's lending operations, policies, and practices. This access enables examiners to review and analyze the institution's compliance with fair lending laws and regulations, as well as to assess any potential discriminatory conduct in the lending process.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","c. How and when the policy or communication was put
into effect.
d. How widely the policy or communication was applied.
e. Whether and to what extent applicants were adversely
affected by the policy or communication.
Step 2. Where any indicator of overt discrimination was an
oral statement or unwritten practice, determine and
document:
a. The precise nature of both the statement, or practice, and
of the fair lending concerns that they raise.
b. The identity of the persons making the statement or
applying the practice and their descriptions of the
reasons for it and the persons authorizing or directing the
use of the statement or practice.

Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","c. How and when the policy or communication was put
into effect.
d. How widely the policy or communication was applied.
e. Whether and to what extent applicants were adversely
affected by the policy or communication.
Step 2. Where any indicator of overt discrimination was an
oral statement or unwritten practice, determine and
document:
a. The precise nature of both the statement, or practice, and
of the fair lending concerns that they raise.
b. The identity of the persons making the statement or
applying the practice and their descriptions of the
reasons for it and the persons authorizing or directing the
use of the statement or practice.
",correct,"The answer correctly defines the terms 'involved in making any determination concerning a covered application from a small business' and 'should have access' based on the reference text provided. The definition of 'involved' includes individuals who assess or decide on loan applications from small businesses, such as underwriters and loan officers. The definition of 'should have access' refers to providing examiners with necessary information to evaluate lending operations and compliance with fair lending laws. The answer aligns with the details and examples given in the reference text.",
76,76,77,reg b,3fc2de0cdb548634,"Under what circumstances can a creditor refuse to extend credit or terminate an account based on the availability of credit-related insurance, as outlined in the context information?","A creditor can refuse to extend credit or terminate an account based on the availability of credit-related insurance if there are differences in the availability, rates, and other terms of the insurance offered or provided to an applicant. This action does not violate Regulation B.","(See § 1002.6(c) on consideration of state property laws.)
3. Renewals. If the borrower's creditworthiness is reevaluated when a credit obligation is renewed, the creditor must
determine whether an additional party is still warranted and, if not warranted, release the additional party.
1. Guarantees. A guarantee on an extension of credit is part of a credit transaction and therefore subject to the
regulation. A creditor may require the personal guarantee of the partners, directors, or officers of a business, and
the shareholders of a closely held corporation, even if the business or corporation is creditworthy. The
requirement must be based on the guarantor's relationship with the business or corporation, however, and not on
a prohibited basis. For example, a creditor may not require guarantees only for women-owned or minority-owned
businesses. Similarly, a creditor may not require guarantees only of the married officers of a business or the
married shareholders of a closely held corporation.
2. Spousal guarantees. The rules in § 1002.7(d) bar a creditor from requiring the signature of a guarantor's spouse
just as they bar the creditor from requiring the signature of an applicant's spouse. For example, although a
creditor may require all officers of a closely held corporation to personally guarantee a corporate loan, the
creditor may not automatically require that spouses of married officers also sign the guarantee. If an evaluation
of the financial circumstances of an officer indicates that an additional signature is necessary, however, the
creditor may require the signature of another person in appropriate circumstances in accordance with §
1002.7(d)(2).
1. Differences in terms. Differences in the availability, rates, and other terms on which credit-related casualty
insurance or credit life, health, accident, or disability insurance is offered or provided to an applicant does not
violate Regulation B.
2. Insurance information. A creditor may obtain information about an applicant's age, sex, or marital status for
insurance purposes. The information may only be used for determining eligibility and premium rates for
insurance, however, and not in making the credit decision.
1. Determining qualified programs.

On the applicant's request, however, a creditor must consider credit information not
reported through a credit bureau when the information relates to the same types of credit references and history
that the creditor would consider if reported through a credit bureau.
2. National origin—citizenship. A denial of credit on the ground that an applicant is not a United States citizen is not
per se discrimination based on national origin.
1. Prohibited basis—marital status. A creditor may consider the marital status of an applicant or joint applicant for
the purpose of ascertaining the creditor's rights and remedies applicable to the particular extension of credit. For
example, in a secured transaction involving real property, a creditor could take into account whether state law
gives the applicant's spouse an interest in the property being offered as collateral.
7
(a) Individual accounts.
1. Open-end credit—authorized user. A creditor may not require a creditworthy applicant seeking an individual credit
account to provide additional signatures. But the creditor may condition the designation of an authorized user by
the account holder on the authorized user's becoming contractually liable for the account, as long as the creditor
does not differentiate on any prohibited basis in imposing this requirement.
2. Open-end credit—choice of authorized user. A creditor that permits an account holder to designate an authorized
user may not restrict this designation on a prohibited basis. For example, if the creditor allows the designation of
spouses as authorized users, the creditor may not refuse to accept a non-spouse as an authorized user.
3. Overdraft authority on transaction accounts. If a transaction account (such as a checking account or NOW
account) includes an overdraft line of credit, the creditor may require that all persons authorized to draw on the
transaction account assume liability for any overdraft.
1. Single name on account. A creditor may require that joint applicants on an account designate a single name for
purposes of administering the account and that a single name be embossed on any credit cards issued on the
account. But the creditor may not require that the name be the husband's name.",1,True,,"Under what circumstances can a creditor refuse to extend credit or terminate an account based on the availability of credit-related insurance, as outlined in the context information?","A creditor can refuse to extend credit or terminate an account based on the availability of credit-related insurance if the creditor has a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for doing so. This could include situations where the creditor determines that the credit-related insurance is not available for the particular type of credit being extended or if the insurance is not required by law.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.
R6. Explicit demarcation of credit product markets that
excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively
high concentrations of minority residents.
R7. Difference in services available or hours of operation at
branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.
R8. Policies on receipt and processing of applications,
pricing, conditions, or appraisals and valuation, or on any
other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R9. The institution’s CRA assessment area appears to have
been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.

","Under what circumstances can a creditor refuse to extend credit or terminate an account based on the availability of credit-related insurance, as outlined in the context information?","A creditor can refuse to extend credit or terminate an account based on the availability of credit-related insurance if the insurance is not available from a source other than the creditor, and the insurance is required in order to obtain the credit.","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a

prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.

borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.

",correct,"To determine if the answer is correct, we need to analyze if it addresses the circumstances under which a creditor can refuse to extend credit or terminate an account based on the availability of credit-related insurance as outlined in the reference text. The answer correctly states that a creditor can refuse to extend credit or terminate an account based on the availability of credit-related insurance if there is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for doing so. It mentions situations where the insurance may not be available for the type of credit being extended or if it is not required by law. These reasons align with the considerations outlined in the reference text, making the answer correct.",
77,77,78,reg b,07819a448c1be477,Is taking corrective action considered an admission of violation according to the document?,Taking corrective action is not considered an admission of violation according to the document.,"In
determining whether it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, a creditor must treat testers as if they are actual applicants for
credit. A creditor may not refuse to take appropriate corrective action under this section because the self-test used fictitious loan
applicants. The fact that a tester's agreement with the creditor waives the tester's legal right to assert a violation does not eliminate
the requirement for the creditor to take corrective action, although no remedial relief for the tester is required under paragraph 15(c)
(3).
15(c)(2) Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action.
1. Whether a creditor has taken or is taking corrective action that is appropriate will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Generally,
the scope of the corrective action that is needed to preserve the privilege is governed by the scope of the self-test. For example, a
creditor that self-tests mortgage loans and discovers evidence of discrimination may focus its corrective actions on mortgage loans,
and is not required to expand its testing to other types of loans.
15(c)(3) Types of relief.
Paragraph 15(c)(3)(ii).
Paragraph 15(c)(3)(iii).
2. In identifying the policies or practices that are a likely cause of the violation, a creditor might identify inadequate
or improper lending policies, failure to implement established policies, employee conduct, or other causes. The
extent and scope of a likely violation may be assessed by determining which areas of operations are likely to be
affected by those policies and practices, for example, by determining the types of loans and stages of the
application process involved and the branches or offices where the violations may have occurred.
3. Depending on the method and scope of the self-test and the results of the test, appropriate corrective action may
include one or more of the following:
i. If the self-test identifies individuals whose applications were inappropriately processed, offering to extend
credit if the application was improperly denied and compensating such persons for out-of-pocket costs and
other compensatory damages;
ii. Correcting institutional policies or procedures that may have contributed to the likely violation, and adopting
new policies as appropriate;
iii. Identifying and then training and/or disciplining the employees involved;
iv.

The privilege covers workpapers or draft documents as well as final documents.
(3) Types of information not privileged. The privilege under this section does not apply to:
(i) Information about whether a creditor conducted a self-test, the methodology used or the scope of the self-test,
the time period covered by the self-test, or the dates it was conducted; or
(ii) Loan and application files or other business records related to credit transactions, and information derived from
such files and records, even if the information has been aggregated, summarized, or reorganized to facilitate
analysis.
(c) Appropriate corrective action —
(1) General requirement. For the privilege in this section to apply, appropriate corrective action is required when the self-
test shows that it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, even though no violation has been formally
adjudicated.
(2) Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action. A creditor must take corrective action that is reasonably likely
to remedy the cause and effect of a likely violation by:
(i) Identifying the policies or practices that are the likely cause of the violation; and
(ii) Assessing the extent and scope of any violation.
(3) Types of relief. Appropriate corrective action may include both prospective and remedial relief, except that to establish
a privilege under this section:
(i) A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a tester used in a self-test;
(ii) A creditor is only required to provide remedial relief to an applicant identified by the self-test as one whose rights
were more likely than not violated; and

(iii) A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a particular applicant if the statute of limitations applicable
to the violation expired before the creditor obtained the results of the self-test or the applicant is otherwise
ineligible for such relief.

feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.17
information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.18 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
control group applicant who appears less qualified than
the benchmark applicant should be identified on the
spreadsheet as a “control group overlap.”
g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.
","Identify the institution’s marketing initiatives.

intermediaries it will solicit.
o Identify the parties contacted and determine the
distribution between minority and non-minority
areas.
o Obtain and review the types of information the
institution distributes to intermediaries.
o Determine how often the institution contacts
intermediaries.
o Determine what criteria the institution

Step 2. Document the policies, conditions, or criteria that
have been adopted by the institution for determining how
referrals are to be made and choices presented to applicants.
a. Obtain not only information regarding the product or
feature offered by the institution and alternatives
offered by subsidiaries/affiliates, but also information
on alternatives offered solely by the institution itself.
b. Obtain any information regarding a subsidiary of the
institution directly from that entity, but seek
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations

information regarding an affiliate or holding company
subsidiary only from the institution itself.
c. Obtain all appropriate documentation and provide a
written summary of all discussions with loan
personnel and managers.
d. Obtain documentation and/or employee estimates as to
the volume of referrals made from or to the institution,
for each product, during a relevant time period.
e. Resolve to the extent possible any discrepancies
between information found in the institution’s
documents and information obtained in discussions
with loan personnel and managers by conducting
appropriate follow-up interviews.
f. Identify any policies and procedures established by the
institution and/or the subsidiary or affiliate for (i)
referring a person who applies to the institution, but
does not meet its criteria, to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) offering one or
more alternatives to a person who applies to the
institution for a specific product or feature, but does
not meet its criteria; or (iii) referring a person who
applies to a subsidiary or affiliate for its product, but
who appears qualified for a loan from the institution, to
the institution; or referring a person who applies
through one internal lending channel for a product, but
who appears to be qualified for a loan through another
lending channel to that particular lending channel.
g. Determine whether loan personnel are encouraged,
through financial incentives or otherwise, to make
referrals, either from the institution to a
subsidiary/affiliate or vice versa. Similarly,
determine whether the institution provides
financial incentives related to products and
features.
Step 3. Determine how referral decisions are made and
documented within the institution.
Determine how a referral is made to another internal lending
channel, subsidiary, or affiliate. Determine the reason for
referral and how it is documented.
Step 4. Determine to what extent individual loan personnel
are able to exercise personal discretion in deciding what loan
products or other credit alternatives will be made available to
a given applicant.
Step 5. Determine whether the institution’s stated policies,
conditions, or criteria in fact are adhered to by individual
decision makers. If not, does it appear that different policies
or practices are actually in effect?
Enter data from the prohibited basis group sample on the
spread sheets and determine whether the institution is, in fact,
applying its criteria as stated. For example, if one announced
criterion for receiving a “more favorable” prime mortgage
loan was a back end debt ratio of no more than 38%, review
the spread sheets to determine whether that criteria was
adhered to. If the institution’s actual treatment of prohibited
basis group applicants appears to differ from its stated
criteria, document such differences for subsequent discussion
with management.
Step 6. To the extent that individual loan personnel have any
discretion in deciding what products and features to offer
applicants, conduct a comparative analysis to determine
whether that discretion has been exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Compare the institution’s or subsidiary/affiliate’s treatment of
control group and prohibited basis group applicants by
adapting the “benchmark” and “overlap” technique discussed
in Part III, Section C of these procedures. For purposes of
this Steering Analysis, that technique should be conducted as
follows:
a. For each focal point to be analyzed, select a sample of
prohibited basis group applicants who received “less
favorable” treatment (e.g., referral to a finance
company or a subprime mortgage subsidiary or
counteroffers of less favorable product alternatives).
NOTE: In selecting the sample, follow the guidance of
Fair Lending Sample Size Tables, Table B in the
Appendix and select “marginal applicants” as
instructed in Part III, Section C, above.
b. Prepare a spread sheet for the sample which contains
data entry categories for those underwriting and/or
referral criteria that the institution identified in Step 1.b
as used in reaching underwriting and referral decisions
between the pairs of products.
c. Review the “less favorably” treated prohibited basis
group sample and rank this sample from least qualified
to most qualified.
d. From the sample, identify the best qualified prohibited
basis group applicant, based on the criteria identified
for the control group, above. This applicant will be
the “benchmark” applicant. Rank order the remaining
applicants from best to least qualified.
e. Select a sample of control group applicants. Identify
those who were treated “more favorably” with respect to
the same product-alternative product pair as the
prohibited basis group. (Again refer to the Sample Size
Table B and marginal applicant processes noted above
in selecting the sample.)
f. Compare the qualifications of the benchmark applicant
with those of the control group applicants, beginning
with the least qualified member of that sample. Any

g. Compare all control group overlaps with other, less
qualified prohibited basis group applicants to
determine whether additional overlaps exist
h. Document all overlaps as possible disparities in treatment.
Discuss all overlaps and related findings (e.g., any
differences between stated and actual underwriting and/or
referral criteria) with management, documenting all such
conversations.

",incorrect,"The answer provided correctly lists some of the types of financial institutions that can be selected when reporting under § 1002.109(b)(9), such as banks, credit unions, savings associations, mortgage companies, and finance companies. However, it misses mentioning minority depository institutions, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), other nonprofit financial institutions, Farm Credit System institutions, government lenders, equipment finance companies, industrial loan companies, online lenders, and the option to select 'other' with free-form text. Therefore, the answer is incomplete as it does not cover all the types mentioned in the reference text.",
80,80,81,reg b,fbc5613cb3b84d72,How does the threshold for determining bona fide errors differ for financial institutions with fewer than 30 entries in their small business lending application register?,"Financial institutions with fewer than 30 entries in their small business lending application register are subject to a different threshold for determining bona fide errors. Specifically, if a financial institution has less than 30 entries, they are allowed one error per data field before it is considered a violation of the Act or the relevant subpart.","The thresholds in column C of the Threshold Table reflect the number of unintentional errors a financial institution may make within a
particular data field (e.g., the credit product data field within the credit type data point or the ethnicity data field for a particular
principal owner within the ethnicity, race, and sex of principal owners data point) in a small business lending application register that
would be deemed bona fide errors for purposes of § 1002.112(b).
For instance, a financial institution that submitted a small business lending application register containing 105 applications would be
subject to a threshold of three errors per data field. If the financial institution had made two errors in reporting loan amount and two
errors reporting gross annual income, all of these errors would be covered by the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b) and
would not constitute a violation of the Act or this part. If the same financial institution had made four errors in reporting loan amount
and two errors reporting gross annual income, the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b) would not apply to the four loan amount
errors but would still apply to the two gross annual income errors.
Even when the number of errors in a particular data field do not equal or exceed the threshold in column C, if either there is a
reasonable basis to believe that errors in that field were intentional or there is evidence that the financial institution did not maintain
procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors, then the errors are not bona fide errors under § 1002.112(b).
For purposes of determining bona fide errors under § 1002.112(b), the term “data field” generally refers to individual fields. Some data
fields may allow for more than one response. For example, with respect to information on the ethnicity or race of an applicant's
principal owners, a data field may identify more than one race or more than one ethnicity for a given person. If one or more of the
ethnicities or races identified in a data field are erroneous, they count as one (and only one) error for that data field.

(c) Limitation on personally identifiable information in certain records retained under this section. In reporting a small business
lending application register pursuant to § 1002.109, maintaining the register pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and
maintaining a separate record of information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, a financial institution shall not
include any name, specific address, telephone number, email address, or any other personally identifiable information
concerning any individual who is, or is connected with, an applicant, other than as required pursuant to § 1002.107 or
paragraph (b) of this section.
(a) Administrative enforcement and civil liability. A violation of section 704B of the Act or this subpart is subject to
administrative sanctions and civil liability as provided in sections 704 (15 U.S.C. 1691c) and 706 (15 U.S.C. 1691e) of the
Act, where applicable.
(b) Bona fide errors. A bona fide error in compiling, maintaining, or reporting data with respect to a covered application is one
that was unintentional and occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such an error. A
bona fide error is not a violation of the Act or this subpart. A financial institution is presumed to maintain procedures
reasonably adapted to avoid such errors with respect to a given data field if the number of errors found in a random sample
of the financial institution's submission for the data field does not equal or exceed a threshold specified by the Bureau for
this purpose in appendix F to this part. However, an error is not a bona fide error if either there is a reasonable basis to
believe the error was intentional or there is evidence that the financial institution does not or has not maintained procedures
reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.
(c) Safe harbors —
(1) Incorrect entry for application date. A financial institution does not violate the Act or this subpart if it reports on its
small business lending application register an application date that is within three business days of the actual
application date pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(2).
(2) Incorrect entry for census tract.",1,True,,How does the threshold for determining bona fide errors differ for financial institutions with fewer than 30 entries in their small business lending application register?,The threshold for determining bona fide errors for financial institutions with fewer than 30 entries in their small business lending application register is based on a different calculation method compared to institutions with 30 or more entries.,"Step 7. Examiners should consult with their agency’s
supervisory staff if they see a need to contact control group
or prohibited basis group applicants to substantiate the
steering analysis.
F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are

questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary

residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.

a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
","Document all responses that have been provided
by the institution, not just its “best” or “final” response.
Document each discussion with dates, names, titles,
questions, responses, any information that supports or
undercuts the institution’s credibility, and any other
information that bears on the issues raised in the
discussion(s).
Step 3. Evaluate whether the responses are consistent with
previous statements, information obtained from file
review, documents, reasonable banking practices, and
other sources, and satisfy common-sense standards of logic
and credibility.
a. Do not speculate or assume that the institution’s
decision- maker had specific intentions or
considerations in mind when he or she took the actions
being evaluated. Do not, for example, conclude that
because you have noticed a legitimate,
nondiscriminatory reason for a denial (such as an
applicant’s credit weakness), that no discrimination
occurred unless it is clear that, at the time of the denial,
the institution actually based the denial on that reason.
b. Perform follow-up file reviews and comparative
analyses, as necessary, to determine the accuracy and
credibility of the institution’s explanations.
c. Refer to Evaluating Responses to Evidence of
Disparate Treatment in the Appendix for guidance as
to common types of responses.

IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.26 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Violations portion of the Special Analyses section of
the Appendix for guidance on evaluating the
institution’s responses to apparent disparate impact.
Step 4. If, after completing Steps 1–3 above, you conclude
that the institution has failed to adequately demonstrate
that one or more apparent violations had a legitimate
nondiscriminatory basis or were otherwise lawful, prepare
a documented list or discussion of violations, or a draft
examination report, as prescribed by agency directives.
Step 5. Consult with agency supervisory staff regarding
whether (a) any violations should be referred to the
Departments of Justice or Housing and Urban
Development and (b) enforcement action should be
undertaken by your agency.

credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
","Document all responses that have been provided
by the institution, not just its “best” or “final” response.
Document each discussion with dates, names, titles,
questions, responses, any information that supports or
undercuts the institution’s credibility, and any other
information that bears on the issues raised in the
discussion(s).
Step 3. Evaluate whether the responses are consistent with
previous statements, information obtained from file
review, documents, reasonable banking practices, and
other sources, and satisfy common-sense standards of logic
and credibility.
a. Do not speculate or assume that the institution’s
decision- maker had specific intentions or
considerations in mind when he or she took the actions
being evaluated. Do not, for example, conclude that
because you have noticed a legitimate,
nondiscriminatory reason for a denial (such as an
applicant’s credit weakness), that no discrimination
occurred unless it is clear that, at the time of the denial,
the institution actually based the denial on that reason.
b. Perform follow-up file reviews and comparative
analyses, as necessary, to determine the accuracy and
credibility of the institution’s explanations.
c. Refer to Evaluating Responses to Evidence of
Disparate Treatment in the Appendix for guidance as
to common types of responses.
d. Refer to the Disproportionate Adverse Impact
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.26 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Violations portion of the Special Analyses section of
the Appendix for guidance on evaluating the
institution’s responses to apparent disparate impact.
Step 4. If, after completing Steps 1–3 above, you conclude
that the institution has failed to adequately demonstrate
that one or more apparent violations had a legitimate
nondiscriminatory basis or were otherwise lawful, prepare
a documented list or discussion of violations, or a draft
examination report, as prescribed by agency directives.
Step 5. Consult with agency supervisory staff regarding
whether (a) any violations should be referred to the
Departments of Justice or Housing and Urban
Development and (b) enforcement action should be
undertaken by your agency.
","How should a financial institution maintain the record of an applicant's responses regarding principal owners' ethnicity, race, and sex separate from the application?","The financial institution should maintain the record of an applicant's responses regarding principal owners' ethnicity, race, and sex separate from the application by documenting each discussion with dates, names, titles, questions, responses, and any other relevant information that supports or undercuts the institution's credibility. This documentation should be kept distinct from the application files to ensure transparency and compliance with regulations.","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.

FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.1
Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","How does Regulation B address differences in terms for credit-related casualty insurance or credit life, health, accident, or disability insurance offered to an applicant?","Regulation B prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction, including the terms for credit-related casualty insurance or credit life, health, accident, or disability insurance offered to an applicant. It ensures that there is no discrimination based on prohibited factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of income from public assistance programs, or the exercise of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act when offering these insurance products to an applicant.","M6. *Proportion of prohibited basis applicants is

Step Five: Organize and Focus Residential Risk Analysis
Review the risk factors identified in Step 4 and, for each loan
product that displays risk factors, articulate the possible
discriminatory effects encountered and organize the
examination of those loan products in accordance with the
following guidance. For complex issues regarding these
factors, consult with agency supervisory staff.
• Where overt evidence of discrimination, as described in
factors O1-O5, has been found in connection with a
product, document those findings as described in Part III,
B, besides completing the remainder of the planned
examination analysis.
• Where any of the risk factors U1-U9 are present,
consider conducting an underwriting comparative file
analysis as described in Part III, C.
• Where any of the risk factors P1-P7 are present,
consider conducting a pricing comparative file analysis
as described in Part III, D.
• Where any of the risk factors S1-S8 are present,
consider conducting a steering analysis as described in

surrogates to identify possible prohibited basis group
individuals.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.

Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits

trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;

• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
",correct,"The answer correctly explains that Regulation B prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction, including the terms for credit-related insurance offered to an applicant. It mentions that lenders cannot vary the terms of credit based on prohibited factors outlined in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The answer addresses the question by explaining how Regulation B addresses differences in terms for credit-related insurance.",
83,83,84,reg b,7b7f439ec93f89ca,When is a creditor allowed to obtain the signature of a parent as a guarantor in a guaranteed student loan program?,A creditor is allowed to obtain the signature of a parent as a guarantor in a guaranteed student loan program when the creditor has determined that the student alone does not qualify for the credit requested.,"(See § 1002.6(c) on consideration of state property laws.)
3. Renewals. If the borrower's creditworthiness is reevaluated when a credit obligation is renewed, the creditor must
determine whether an additional party is still warranted and, if not warranted, release the additional party.
1. Guarantees. A guarantee on an extension of credit is part of a credit transaction and therefore subject to the
regulation. A creditor may require the personal guarantee of the partners, directors, or officers of a business, and
the shareholders of a closely held corporation, even if the business or corporation is creditworthy. The
requirement must be based on the guarantor's relationship with the business or corporation, however, and not on
a prohibited basis. For example, a creditor may not require guarantees only for women-owned or minority-owned
businesses. Similarly, a creditor may not require guarantees only of the married officers of a business or the
married shareholders of a closely held corporation.
2. Spousal guarantees. The rules in § 1002.7(d) bar a creditor from requiring the signature of a guarantor's spouse
just as they bar the creditor from requiring the signature of an applicant's spouse. For example, although a
creditor may require all officers of a closely held corporation to personally guarantee a corporate loan, the
creditor may not automatically require that spouses of married officers also sign the guarantee. If an evaluation
of the financial circumstances of an officer indicates that an additional signature is necessary, however, the
creditor may require the signature of another person in appropriate circumstances in accordance with §
1002.7(d)(2).
1. Differences in terms. Differences in the availability, rates, and other terms on which credit-related casualty
insurance or credit life, health, accident, or disability insurance is offered or provided to an applicant does not
violate Regulation B.
2. Insurance information. A creditor may obtain information about an applicant's age, sex, or marital status for
insurance purposes. The information may only be used for determining eligibility and premium rates for
insurance, however, and not in making the credit decision.
1. Determining qualified programs.

While
a reapplication is pending, the creditor must allow the account holder full access to the account under the existing
contract terms. The creditor may specify a reasonable time period within which the account holder must submit the
required information.
1. Qualified applicant. The signature rules ensure that qualified applicants are able to obtain credit in their own
names. Thus, when an applicant requests individual credit, a creditor generally may not require the signature of
another person unless the creditor has first determined that the applicant alone does not qualify for the credit
requested.
2. Unqualified applicant. When an applicant requests individual credit but does not meet a creditor's standards, the
creditor may require a cosigner, guarantor, endorser, or similar party—but cannot require that it be the spouse.
(See commentary to §§ 1002.7(d)(5) and (6).)
1. Signature of another person. It is impermissible for a creditor to require an applicant who is individually
creditworthy to provide a cosigner—even if the creditor applies the requirement without regard to sex, marital
status, or any other prohibited basis. (But see comment 7(d)(6)-1 concerning guarantors of closely held
corporations.)
2. Joint applicant. The term “joint applicant” refers to someone who applies contemporaneously with the applicant
for shared or joint credit. It does not refer to someone whose signature is required by the creditor as a condition
for granting the credit requested.
3. Evidence of joint application. A person's intent to be a joint applicant must be evidenced at the time of application.
Signatures on a promissory note may not be used to show intent to apply for joint credit. On the other hand,
signatures or initials on a credit application affirming applicants' intent to apply for joint credit may be used to
establish intent to apply for joint credit. (See appendix B.) The method used to establish intent must be distinct
from the means used by individuals to affirm the accuracy of information. For example, signatures on a joint
financial statement affirming the veracity of information are not sufficient to establish intent to apply for joint
credit.",1,True,,When is a creditor allowed to obtain the signature of a parent as a guarantor in a guaranteed student loan program?,A creditor is allowed to obtain the signature of a parent as a guarantor in a guaranteed student loan program when the parent is considered a co-applicant or co-signer for the loan.,"I. Credit Scoring.
If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
J. Disparate Impact Issues.
","NOTE: The term surrogate in this context refers to any factor
related to a loan applicant that potentially identifies that
applicant’s race, color, or other prohibited basis
characteristic in instances where no direct evidence of that
characteristic is available. Thus, in consumer lending, where
monitoring data is generally unavailable, a Hispanic or Asian
surname could constitute a surrogate for an applicant’s race
or national origin because the examiner can assume that the
institution (which can rebut the presumption) perceived the
person to be Hispanic or Asian. Similarly, an applicant’s
given name could serve as a surrogate for his or her gender.
A surrogate for a prohibited basis group characteristic may be
used to set up a comparative analysis with control group
applicants or borrowers.
Examiners should then follow the rules in Steps Three
through Five, above and identify the possible discriminatory
patterns encountered and consider examining those products
determined to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct.
Step Seven: Identify Commercial Lending Discrimination
Risk Factors
Where an institution does a substantial amount of lending in
the commercial lending market, most notably small business
lending and the product has not recently been examined or
the underwriting standards have changed since the last
examination of the product, the examiner should consider
conducting a risk factor review similar to that performed for
residential lending products, as feasible, given the limited
information available. Such an analysis should generally be
limited to determining risk potential based on risk factors
U4- U8; P1-P3; R5-R7; and M1-M3.
If the institution makes commercial loans insured by the
Small Business Administration (SBA), determine from
agency supervisory staff whether SBA loan data (which
codes race and other factors) are available for the institution
and evaluate those data pursuant to instructions
accompanying them.
For large institutions reporting small business loans for
CRA purposes and where the institution also voluntarily
geocodes loan denials, look for material discrepancies in
ratios of approval-to-denial rates for applications in areas
with high concentrations of minority residents compared to
areas with concentrations of non-minority residents.
Articulate the possible discriminatory patterns identified
and consider further examining those products determined
to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct in
accordance with the procedures for commercial lending
described in Part III, F.
Step Eight: Complete the Scoping Process
To complete the scoping process, the examiner should
review the results of the preceding steps and select those
focal points that warrant examination, based on the relative
risk levels identified above. In order to remain within the
agency’s resource allowances, the examiner may need to
choose a smaller number of focal points from among all
those selected on the basis of risk. In such instances, set the
scope by first, prioritizing focal points on the basis of (i)
high number and/or relative severity of risk factors; (ii) high
data quality and other factors affecting the likelihood of
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.12 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
obtaining reliable examination results; (iii) high loan volume
and the likelihood of widespread risk to applicants and
borrowers; and (iv) low quality of any compliance program
and, second, selecting for examination review as many focal
points as resources permit.
Where the judgment process among competing focal points is
a close call, information learned in the phase of conducting the
compliance management review can be used to further refine
the examiner’s choices.
Part II — Compliance Management Review
The Compliance Management Review enables the
examination team to determine:
• The intensity of the current examination based on an
evaluation of the compliance management measures
employed by an institution.
• The reliability of the institution’s practices and procedures
for ensuring continued fair lending compliance.
Generally, the review should focus on:
• Determining whether the policies and procedures of the
institution enable management to prevent, or to identify
and self-correct, illegal disparate treatment in the
transactions that relate to the products and issues
identified for further analysis under Part I of these
procedures.
• Obtaining a thorough understanding of the manner by
which management addresses its fair lending
responsibilities with respect to (a) the institution’s lending
practices and standards, (b) training and other applicationprocessing aids, (c) guidance to employees or agents in
dealing with customers, and (d) its marketing or other
promotion of products and services.
To conduct this review, examiners should consider institutional
records and interviews with appropriate management personnel
in the lending, compliance, audit, and legal functions. The
examiner should also refer to the Compliance Management
Analysis Checklist contained in the Appendix to evaluate the
strength of the compliance programs in terms of their capacity
to prevent, or to identify and self- correct, fair lending
violations in connection with the products or issues selected for
analysis. Based on this evaluation:
• Set the intensity of the transaction analysis by minimizing
sample sizes within the guidelines established in Part III
and the Fair Lending Sample Size Tables in the
Appendix, to the extent warranted by the strength and
thoroughness of the compliance programs applicable to
those focal points selected for examination.
 3 This reflects the interagency examination procedures in their entirety.

Credit Scoring.
If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.

dealing with customers, and (d) its marketing or other
promotion of products and services.
To conduct this review, examiners should consider institutional
records and interviews with appropriate management personnel
in the lending, compliance, audit, and legal functions. The
examiner should also refer to the Compliance Management
Analysis Checklist contained in the Appendix to evaluate the
strength of the compliance programs in terms of their capacity
to prevent, or to identify and self- correct, fair lending
violations in connection with the products or issues selected for
analysis. Based on this evaluation:
• Set the intensity of the transaction analysis by minimizing
sample sizes within the guidelines established in Part III
and the Fair Lending Sample Size Tables in the
Appendix, to the extent warranted by the strength and
thoroughness of the compliance programs applicable to
those focal points selected for examination.

","NOTE: The term surrogate in this context refers to any factor
related to a loan applicant that potentially identifies that
applicant’s race, color, or other prohibited basis
characteristic in instances where no direct evidence of that
characteristic is available. Thus, in consumer lending, where
monitoring data is generally unavailable, a Hispanic or Asian
surname could constitute a surrogate for an applicant’s race
or national origin because the examiner can assume that the
institution (which can rebut the presumption) perceived the
person to be Hispanic or Asian. Similarly, an applicant’s
given name could serve as a surrogate for his or her gender.
A surrogate for a prohibited basis group characteristic may be
used to set up a comparative analysis with control group
applicants or borrowers.
Examiners should then follow the rules in Steps Three
through Five, above and identify the possible discriminatory
patterns encountered and consider examining those products
determined to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct.
Step Seven: Identify Commercial Lending Discrimination
Risk Factors
Where an institution does a substantial amount of lending in
the commercial lending market, most notably small business
lending and the product has not recently been examined or
the underwriting standards have changed since the last
examination of the product, the examiner should consider
conducting a risk factor review similar to that performed for
residential lending products, as feasible, given the limited
information available. Such an analysis should generally be
limited to determining risk potential based on risk factors
U4- U8; P1-P3; R5-R7; and M1-M3.
If the institution makes commercial loans insured by the
Small Business Administration (SBA), determine from
agency supervisory staff whether SBA loan data (which
codes race and other factors) are available for the institution
and evaluate those data pursuant to instructions
accompanying them.
For large institutions reporting small business loans for
CRA purposes and where the institution also voluntarily
geocodes loan denials, look for material discrepancies in
ratios of approval-to-denial rates for applications in areas
with high concentrations of minority residents compared to
areas with concentrations of non-minority residents.
Articulate the possible discriminatory patterns identified
and consider further examining those products determined
to have sufficient risk of discriminatory conduct in
accordance with the procedures for commercial lending
described in Part III, F.
Step Eight: Complete the Scoping Process
To complete the scoping process, the examiner should
review the results of the preceding steps and select those
focal points that warrant examination, based on the relative
risk levels identified above. In order to remain within the
agency’s resource allowances, the examiner may need to
choose a smaller number of focal points from among all
those selected on the basis of risk. In such instances, set the
scope by first, prioritizing focal points on the basis of (i)
high number and/or relative severity of risk factors; (ii) high
data quality and other factors affecting the likelihood of
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.12 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
obtaining reliable examination results; (iii) high loan volume
and the likelihood of widespread risk to applicants and
borrowers; and (iv) low quality of any compliance program
and, second, selecting for examination review as many focal
points as resources permit.
Where the judgment process among competing focal points is
a close call, information learned in the phase of conducting the
compliance management review can be used to further refine
the examiner’s choices.
Part II — Compliance Management Review
The Compliance Management Review enables the
examination team to determine:
• The intensity of the current examination based on an
evaluation of the compliance management measures
employed by an institution.
• The reliability of the institution’s practices and procedures
for ensuring continued fair lending compliance.
Generally, the review should focus on:
• Determining whether the policies and procedures of the
institution enable management to prevent, or to identify
and self-correct, illegal disparate treatment in the
transactions that relate to the products and issues
identified for further analysis under Part I of these
procedures.
• Obtaining a thorough understanding of the manner by
which management addresses its fair lending
responsibilities with respect to (a) the institution’s lending
practices and standards, (b) training and other applicationprocessing aids, (c) guidance to employees or agents in
dealing with customers, and (d) its marketing or other
promotion of products and services.
To conduct this review, examiners should consider institutional
records and interviews with appropriate management personnel
in the lending, compliance, audit, and legal functions. The
examiner should also refer to the Compliance Management

",correct,The answer correctly states that a creditor is allowed to obtain the signature of a parent as a guarantor in a guaranteed student loan program when the parent is considered a co-applicant or co-signer for the loan. This aligns with the concept of requiring a guarantor for a loan and the specific mention of parents in the context of student loans.,
84,84,85,reg b,7c0514d90a9d9583,What are the key factors that adversely affected the credit score of the applicant?,"Insufficient bank references, type of occupation, insufficient credit experience, and number of recent inquiries on the credit bureau report were the key factors that adversely affected the credit score of the applicant.","A creditor need not describe how or why a factor adversely affected an applicant. For example, the
notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.”
4. Credit scoring system. If a creditor bases the denial or other adverse action on a credit scoring system, the reasons
disclosed must relate only to those factors actually scored in the system. Moreover, no factor that was a principal reason
for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure. The creditor must disclose the actual reasons for denial (for example,
“age of automobile”) even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.
5. Credit scoring —method for selecting reasons. The regulation does not require that any one method be used for selecting
reasons for a credit denial or other adverse action that is based on a credit scoring system. Various methods will meet the
requirements of the regulation. One method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the
average score for each of those factors achieved by applicants whose total score was at or slightly above the minimum
passing score. Another method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average
score for each of those factors achieved by all applicants. These average scores could be calculated during the
development or use of the system. Any other method that produces results substantially similar to either of these methods
is also acceptable under the regulation.
6. Judgmental system. If a creditor uses a judgmental system, the reasons for the denial or other adverse action must relate to
those factors in the applicant's record actually reviewed by the person making the decision.
7. Combined credit scoring and judgmental system. If a creditor denies an application based on a credit evaluation system that
employs both credit scoring and judgmental components, the reasons for the denial must come from the component of the
system that the applicant failed. For example, if a creditor initially credit scores an application and denies the credit request
as a result of that scoring, the reasons disclosed to the applicant must relate to the factors scored in the system.

R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.

loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","I. Credit Scoring.
If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
J. Disparate Impact Issues.
",What are the key factors that adversely affected the credit score of the applicant?,"Factors that adversely affected the credit score of the applicant include a substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/incomplete applications from prohibited basis group applicants compared to other applicants, vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria, lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to underwriting criteria, lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons for exceptions to standard underwriting criteria, relatively high percentages of exceptions to underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs, and potential disparate treatment in pricing such as substantial disparities among prices being quoted or charged to applicants with different prohibited basis characteristics.","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.

P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.

Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.

needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of
financial institutions during prior CRA examinations.
R12. An institution that has most of its branches in
predominantly non-minority neighborhoods at the same
time that the institution’s sub-prime mortgage subsidiary
has branches which are located primarily in
predominantly minority neighborhoods.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Marketing of
residential products, such as:
M1. Advertising patterns or practices that a reasonable
person would believe indicate prohibited basis
customers are less desirable.
M2. Advertising only in media serving non-minority areas of
the market.
M3. Marketing through brokers or other agents that the
institution knows (or has reason to know) would serve
only one racial or ethnic group in the market.
M4. Use of marketing programs or procedures for residential
loan products that exclude one or more regions or
geographies within the institutions assessment or
marketing area that have significantly higher
percentages of minority group residents than does the
remainder of the assessment or marketing area.
M5. Using mailing or other distribution lists or other
marketing techniques for pre-screened or other offerings
of residential loan products that:
• Explicitly exclude groups of prospective borrowers on
a prohibited basis; or
• Exclude geographies (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
etc.) within the institution’s marketing area that have
significantly higher percentages of minority group
residents than does the remainder of the marketing area.
","• Learn the level of lending in the suspected
redlining area by competitors. Check any public
evaluations of similarly situated competitors
obtained by the CRA examiners as part of
evaluating the performance context or obtain such
evaluations independently.
f. Institution’s record. Request from the institution
information about its overall record of serving or
attempting to serve the racial or national origin
minority group with which the suspected redlining area
is identified. The record may reveal intent to serve
that group that tends to contradict the view that the
institution intends to discriminate against the group.
NOTE: For any information that supports interpreting
the situation as illegal discrimination, obtain and
evaluate an explanation from the institution as called
for in Part IV. If the institution’s explanation is that the
disparate results are the consequence of a specific,
neutral policy or practice that the institution applies
broadly, such as not making loans on homes below a
certain value, review the guidance in the Special
Analyses section of the Appendix under
Disproportionate Adverse Impact Violations and consult
agency managers.
H. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory Marketing
Practices.
When scoping identifies significant risk factors (M1-M7)
related to marketing, examiners should consult their agency’s
supervisory staff and experts about a possible marketing
discrimination analysis. If the supervisory staff agrees to
proceed, the examiners should collect information as follows:
Step 1. ","Under what circumstances can a creditor that is a financial institution collect information regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of an applicant for an open-end line of credit that is an excluded transaction?","A creditor that is a financial institution can collect information regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of an applicant for an open-end line of credit that is an excluded transaction when the creditor is required to do so for monitoring compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B.","U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

Indicators of potential discriminatory Redlining such as:
R1. *Significant differences, as revealed in HMDA data, in
the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow
requirements) in areas with relatively high concentrations
of minority residents compared with areas with relatively
low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration
of minority residents.

excludes MSAs, political subdivisions, census tracts, or
other geographic areas within the institution’s lending
market or CRA assessment areas and having relatively

branch offices located in areas with concentrations of
minority residents when compared to branch offices
located in areas with concentrations of non-minority
residents.

other aspect of providing residential credit that vary
between areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents and those areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.

been drawn to exclude areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents.
R10.Employee statements that reflect an aversion to doing
business in areas with relatively high concentrations of
minority residents.
R11. Complaints or other allegations by consumers or
community representatives that the institution excludes or
restricts access to credit for areas with relatively high
concentrations of minority residents. Examiners should
review complaints against the institution filed either with
their agency or the institution; the CRA public comment
file; community contact forms; and the responses to
questions about redlining, discrimination, and
discouragement of applications, and about meeting the
needs of racial or national origin minorities, asked as part
of obtaining local perspectives on the performance of

not a covered credit transaction, and the applicant declines to proceed or fails to respond, the
application is reported as a covered application. For example, if an applicant initially applies for a term
loan, but then, after consultation with the financial institution, decides that a lease would better meet
its needs and decides to proceed with that product, the application is not a covered application and
thus is not reported. However, if an applicant initially applies for a term loan, the financial institution
offers to consider the applicant only for a lease, and the applicant refuses, the transaction is a covered
application that must be reported.

Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
Introduction
This overview provides a basic and abbreviated discussion of
federal fair lending laws and regulations. It is adapted from
the Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending issued in
March 1994.
Lending Discrimination Statutes and Regulations
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits
discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It
applies to any extension of credit, including extensions of
credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and
trusts.
The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• Religion;
• National origin;
• Sex;
• Marital status;
• Age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
• The applicant’s receipt of income derived from any
public assistance program; or
• The applicant’s exercise, in good faith, of any right
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulation B,
found at 12 CFR part 1002, implements the ECOA.
Regulation B describes lending acts and practices that are
specifically prohibited, permitted, or required. Official staff
interpretations of the regulation are found in Supplement I to
12 CFR part 1002.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 further amended the ECOA and
covers:
• Data collection for loans to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses (awaiting final regulation);
• Legal action statute of limitations for ECOA
violations is extended to five years (effective July 21, 2010);
and
• A disclosure of the consumer’s ability to receive a
copy of any appraisal(s) and valuation(s) prepared in
connection with first-lien loans secured by a dwelling is to be
provided to applicants within 3 business days of receiving the
application (effective January 18, 2014).
NOTE: Further information regarding the technical
requirements of fair lending are incorporated into the
sections ECOA V 7.1 and FCRA VIII 6.1 of this manual.
The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.

The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) prohibits discrimination in all
aspects of “residential real-estate related transactions,”
including but not limited to:
• Making loans to buy, build, repair, or improve a
dwelling;
• Purchasing real estate loans;
• Selling, brokering, or appraising residential real estate; or
• Selling or renting a dwelling.
The FHAct prohibits discrimination based on:
• Race or color;
• National origin;
• Religion;
• Sex;
• Familial status (defined as children under the age of 18
living with a parent or legal custodian, pregnant women,
and people securing custody of children under 18); or
• Handicap.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
(HUD) regulations implementing the FHAct are found at 24
CFR Part 100. Because both the FHAct and the ECOA
apply to mortgage lending, lenders may not discriminate in
mortgage lending based on any of the prohibited factors in
either list.
Under the ECOA, it is unlawful for a lender to discriminate
on a prohibited basis in any aspect of a credit transaction,
and under both the ECOA and the FHAct, it is unlawful for a
lender to discriminate on a prohibited basis in a residential
real-estate-related transaction. Under one or both of these
laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited factor:
• Fail to provide information or services or provide
different information or services regarding any aspect of
the lending process, including credit availability,
application procedures, or lending standards.
• Discourage or selectively encourage applicants
with respect to inquiries about or applicationsfor
credit.
• Refuse to extend credit or use different standards
in determining whether to extend credit.
• Vary the terms of credit offered, including the
amount, interest rate, duration, or type of loan.
","• Use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan
in the secondary market.
A lender may not express, orally or in writing, a
preference based on prohibited factors or indicate that it
will treat applicants differently on a prohibited basis. A
violation may still exist even if a lender treated applicants
equally.
A lender may not discriminate on a prohibited basis because
of the characteristics of
• An applicant, prospective applicant, or borrower.
• A person associated with an applicant, prospective
applicant, or borrower (for example, a co-applicant,
spouse, business partner, or live-in aide).
• The present or prospective occupants of either the
property to be financed or the characteristics of the
neighborhood or other area where property to be financed
is located.
Finally, the FHAct requires lenders to make reasonable
accommodationsfor a person with disabilities when such
accommodations are necessary to afford the person an equal
opportunity to apply for credit.
Types of Lending Discrimination
The courts have recognized three methods of proof of lending
discrimination under the ECOA and the FHAct:
• Overt evidence of disparate treatment;
• Comparative evidence of disparate treatment; and
• Evidence of disparate impact.
Disparate Treatment
The existence of illegal disparate treatment may be established
either by statements revealing that a lender explicitly
considered prohibited factors (overt evidence) or by
differences in treatment that are not fully explained by
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors (comparative evidence).
Overt Evidence of Disparate Treatment. There is overt
evidence of discrimination when a lender openly discriminates
on a prohibited basis.
Example: A lender offered a credit card with a limit of up to
$750 for applicants aged 21-30 and $1500 for applicants over
30. This policy violated the ECOA’s prohibition on
discrimination based on age.
There is overt evidence of discrimination even when a lender
expresses — but does not act on — a discriminatory
preference:
Example: A lending officer told a customer, “We do not like
to make home mortgages to Native Americans, but the law
says we cannot discriminate and we have to comply with the
law.” This statement violated the FHAct’s prohibition on
statements expressing a discriminatory preference as well as
Section 1002.4(b) of Regulation B, which prohibits
discouraging applicants on a prohibited basis.
Comparative Evidence of Disparate Treatment. Disparate
treatment occurs when a lender treats a credit applicant
differently based on one of the prohibited bases. It does
not require any showing that the treatment was motivated
by prejudice or a conscious intention to discriminate
against a person beyond the difference in treatment itself.
Disparate treatment may more likely occur in the treatment of
applicants who are neither clearly well-qualified nor clearly
unqualified. Discrimination may more readily affect applicants
in this middle group for two reasons. First, if the applications
are “close cases,” there is more room and need for lender
discretion. Second, whether or not an applicant qualifies may
depend on the level of assistance the lender provides the
applicant in completing an application. The lender may, for
example, propose solutions to credit or other problems
regarding an application, identify compensating factors, and
provide encouragement to the applicant. Lenders are under no
obligation to provide such assistance, but to the extent that they
do, the assistance must be provided in a nondiscriminatory
way.
Example: A non-minority couple applied for an automobile
loan. The lender found adverse information in the couple’s
credit report. The lender discussed the credit report with
them and determined that the adverse information, a
judgment against the couple, was incorrect because the
judgment had been vacated. The non-minority couple was
granted their loan. A minority couple applied for a similar
loan with the same lender. Upon discovering adverse
information in the minority couple’s credit report, the lender
denied the loan application on the basis of the adverse
information without giving the couple an opportunity to
discuss the report.
The foregoing is an example of disparate treatment of
similarly situated applicants, apparently based on a
prohibited factor, in the amount of assistance and
information the lender provided.
If a lender has apparently treated similar applicants
differently on the basis of a prohibited factor, it must
provide an explanation for the difference in treatment. If the
lender’s explanation is found to be not credible, the agency
may find that the lender discriminated.
",incorrect,"The answer provided does not directly address the specific circumstances that are not covered under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as outlined in the reference text. The reference text lists out the specific circumstances that are not covered, such as trade credit, HMDA-reportable transactions, insurance premium financing, public utilities credit, securities credit, and incidental credit. The answer mentions failing to provide information or services, discouraging or selectively encouraging applicants, refusing to extend credit, using different standards in determining credit extension, varying the terms of credit offered, and using different standards for pooling or packaging a loan in the secondary market, which are not the exact circumstances outlined in the reference text.",
87,87,88,reg b,5097735fe9a280c0,Explain the conditions under which the gross annual revenue threshold would or would not adjust according to the given document.,"The gross annual revenue threshold will adjust based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) between specific years. If the percentage change in CPI-U between the base year and the comparison year results in a significant adjustment to the threshold amount, it will be rounded to the nearest $500,000. However, if the adjustment does not result in a significant change and the rounded value remains the same as the original threshold, then there will be no adjustment made to the gross annual revenue threshold.","If a covered financial institution receives a covered application from multiple
businesses who are not affiliates, as defined by § 1002.102(a), where at least one business is a small
business under § 1002.106(b), the financial institution shall compile, maintain, and report data
pursuant to §§ 1002.107 through 1002.109 regarding the covered application for only a single
applicant that is a small business. See comment 103(a)-10 for additional details.
1. Inflation adjustment methodology. The small business gross annual revenue threshold set forth in §
1002.106(b)(1) will be adjusted upward or downward to reflect changes, if any, in the Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers (U.S. city average series for all items, not seasonally adjusted), as
published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (“CPI-U”). The base for computing each
adjustment is the January 2025 CPI-U; this base value shall be compared to the CPI-U value in January
2030 and every five years thereafter. For example, after the January 2030 CPI-U is made available, the
adjustment is calculated by determining the percentage change in the CPI-U between January 2025
and January 2030, applying this change to the $5 million gross annual revenue threshold, and rounding
to the nearest $500,000. If, as a result of this rounding, there is no change in the gross annual revenue
threshold, there will be no adjustment. For example, if in January 2030 the adjusted value were $4.9
million (reflecting a $100,000 decrease from January 2025 CPI-U), then the threshold would not adjust
because $4.9 million would be rounded up to $5 million. If on the other hand, the adjusted value were
$5.7 million, then the threshold would adjust to $5.5 million. Where the adjusted value is a multiple of
$250,000 (e.g., $5,250,000), then the threshold adjusts upward (in this example, to $5,500,000).
2. Substitute for CPI-U.

However, pursuant to § 1002.107(b), if the financial
institution verifies the gross annual revenue provided by the applicant, it must report the verified information. Also, pursuant
to comment 107(c)(1)-5, a financial institution reports updated gross annual revenue data if it obtains more current data
from the applicant during the application process. If a financial institution has already verified gross annual revenue data
and then the applicant updates it, the financial institution reports the information it believes to be more accurate, in its
discretion. The financial institution may use the following language to ask about gross annual revenue and may rely on the
applicant's answer (unless subsequently verified or updated):
2. Gross annual revenue not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined. Pursuant to § 1002.107(c), a financial
institution shall maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which includes the gross
annual revenue of the applicant. However, if a financial institution is nonetheless unable to collect or determine the gross
annual revenue of the applicant, the financial institution reports that the gross annual revenue is “not provided by applicant
and otherwise undetermined.”
3. Affiliate revenue. A financial institution is permitted, but not required, to report the gross annual revenue for the applicant
that includes the revenue of affiliates as well. Likewise, as explained in comment 106(b)(1)-3, in determining whether the
applicant is a small business under § 1002.106(b), a financial institution may rely on an applicant's representations

Step 3. Review Terms and Conditions; Compare with
Borrower Outcomes
a. Review all loan terms and conditions (rates, points,
fees, maturity variations, LTVs, collateral
requirements, etc.) with special attention to those
which are left, in whole or in part, to the discretion of
loan officers or underwriters. For each such term or
condition, identify (a) any prohibited basis group
borrowers in the sample who appear to have been
treated unfavorably with respect to that term or
condition and (b) any control group borrowers who
appear to have been treated favorably with respect to
that term or condition. The examiner’s analysis should
be thoroughly documented in the workpapers.
b. Identify from the sample universe any control group
borrowers who appear to have been treated more
favorably than one or more of the above-identified
prohibited basis group borrowers and who have
pricing or creditworthiness factors (under the
institution’s standards) that are equal to or less
favorable than the prohibited basis group borrowers.
c. Obtain explanations from the appropriate loan officer or
other employee for any differences that exist and
reanalyze the sample for evidence of discrimination.
d. If there is some evidence of violations in the imposition of
terms and conditions but not enough to clearly establish
the existence of a pattern or practice, the examiner should
expand the sample as necessary to determine whether a
pattern or practice does or does not exist.

institution’s management and document all conversations
on an appropriate worksheet. For additional guidance on
evaluating management’s responses, refer to Part A, 1 – 5,

E. Steering Analysis
An institution that offers a variety of lending products or
product features, either through one channel or through
multiple channels, may benefit consumers by offering greater
choices and meeting the diverse needs of applicants. Greater
product offerings and multiple channels, however, may also
create a fair lending risk that applicants will be illegally
steered to certain choices based on prohibited characteristics.
Several examples illustrate potential fair lending risk:
• An institution that offers different lending products based
on credit risk levels may present opportunities for loan
officers or brokers to illegally steer applicants to the
higher-risk products.
• An institution that offers nontraditional loan products or
loan products with potentially onerous terms (such as
prepayment penalties) may present opportunities for loan
officers or brokers to illegally steer applicants to certain
products or features.
• An institution that offers prime or sub-prime products
through different channels may present opportunities for
applicants to be illegally steered to the sub-prime
channel.
The distinction between guiding consumers toward a specific
product or feature and illegal steering centers on whether the
institution did so on a prohibited basis, rather than based on
an applicant’s needs or other legitimate factors. It is not
necessary to demonstrate financial harm to a group that has
been “steered.” It is enough to demonstrate that action was
taken on a prohibited basis regardless of the ultimate
financial outcome. If the scoping analysis reveals the
presence of one or more risk factors S1 through S8 for any
selected focal point, consult with agency supervisory staff
about conducting a steering analysis as described below.
Step 1. ","Discuss all findings resulting from the above
comparisons with management and document both the
findings and all conversations on an appropriate worksheet.
D. Analyzing Potential Disparities in Pricing and Other
Terms and Conditions.
Depending on the intensity of the examination and the size of
the borrower population to be reviewed, the analysis of
decisions on pricing and other terms and conditions may
involve a comparative file review, statistical analysis, a
combination of the two, or other specialized technique used by
an agency. Each examination process assesses an institution’s
credit-decision standards and whether decisions on pricing and
other terms and conditions are applied to borrowers without
regard to a prohibited basis.
The procedures below encompass the examination steps for a
comparative file review. Examiners should consult their own
agency’s procedures for detailed guidance where appropriate.
For example, when file reviews are undertaken in conjunction
with statistical analysis, the guidance on specific sample sizes
referenced below may not apply.
Step 1. Determine Sample Selection
Examiners may review data in its entirety or restrict their
analysis to a sample depending on the examination
approach used and the quality of the institution’s
compliance management system. The Fair Lending Sample
Size Tables in the Appendix provide general guidance about
appropriate sample sizes. Generally, the sample size should
be based on the number of prohibited basis group and
control group originations for each focal point selected
during the 12 months preceding the examination and the
outcome of the compliance management system analysis
conducted in Part II. When possible, examiners should
request specific loan files in advance and request that the
institution have them available for review at the start of the
examination.
Step 2. Determine Sample Composition and Create
Applicant Profiles
Examiners should tailor their sample and subsequent
analysis to the specific factors that the institution considers
when determining its pricing, terms, and conditions. For
example, while decisions on pricing, and other terms and
conditions are part of an institution’s underwriting process,
general underwriting criteria should not be used in the
analysis if they are not relevant to the term or condition to
be reviewed. ",Explain the conditions under which the gross annual revenue threshold would or would not adjust according to the given document.,"The gross annual revenue threshold would adjust based on the intensity of the examination and the size of the borrower population being reviewed.

necessary to demonstrate financial harm to a group that has
been “steered.” It is enough to demonstrate that action was
taken on a prohibited basis regardless of the ultimate
financial outcome. If the scoping analysis reveals the
presence of one or more risk factors S1 through S8 for any
selected focal point, consult with agency supervisory staff
about conducting a steering analysis as described below.
Step 1. ","Discuss all findings resulting from the above
comparisons with management and document both the
findings and all conversations on an appropriate worksheet.
D. Analyzing Potential Disparities in Pricing and Other
Terms and Conditions.
Depending on the intensity of the examination and the size of
the borrower population to be reviewed, the analysis of
decisions on pricing and other terms and conditions may
involve a comparative file review, statistical analysis, a
combination of the two, or other specialized technique used by
an agency. Each examination process assesses an institution’s
credit-decision standards and whether decisions on pricing and
other terms and conditions are applied to borrowers without
regard to a prohibited basis.
The procedures below encompass the examination steps for a
comparative file review. Examiners should consult their own
agency’s procedures for detailed guidance where appropriate.
For example, when file reviews are undertaken in conjunction
with statistical analysis, the guidance on specific sample sizes
referenced below may not apply.
Step 1. Determine Sample Selection
Examiners may review data in its entirety or restrict their
analysis to a sample depending on the examination
approach used and the quality of the institution’s
compliance management system. The Fair Lending Sample
Size Tables in the Appendix provide general guidance about
appropriate sample sizes. Generally, the sample size should
be based on the number of prohibited basis group and
control group originations for each focal point selected
during the 12 months preceding the examination and the
outcome of the compliance management system analysis
conducted in Part II. When possible, examiners should
request specific loan files in advance and request that the
institution have them available for review at the start of the
examination.
Step 2. Determine Sample Composition and Create
Applicant Profiles
Examiners should tailor their sample and subsequent
analysis to the specific factors that the institution considers
when determining its pricing, terms, and conditions. For
example, while decisions on pricing, and other terms and
conditions are part of an institution’s underwriting process,
general underwriting criteria should not be used in the
analysis if they are not relevant to the term or condition to
be reviewed. ",incorrect,"The answer provided does not address the specific conditions under which the gross annual revenue threshold would or would not adjust as outlined in the reference text. The answer focuses on the examination process, credit-decision standards, and sample size determination, which are not directly related to the adjustment of the gross annual revenue threshold based on CPI-U changes.",
88,88,89,reg b,09d5bc0de3ff1541,How should a creditor disclose the reasons for denying a credit request when using a combined credit scoring and judgmental system?,"The reasons for denying a credit request when using a combined credit scoring and judgmental system should come from the component of the system that the applicant failed. If the creditor initially credit scores an application and denies the credit request based on that scoring, the disclosed reasons must relate to the factors scored in the system.","A creditor need not describe how or why a factor adversely affected an applicant. For example, the
notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.”
4. Credit scoring system. If a creditor bases the denial or other adverse action on a credit scoring system, the reasons
disclosed must relate only to those factors actually scored in the system. Moreover, no factor that was a principal reason
for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure. The creditor must disclose the actual reasons for denial (for example,
“age of automobile”) even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.
5. Credit scoring —method for selecting reasons. The regulation does not require that any one method be used for selecting
reasons for a credit denial or other adverse action that is based on a credit scoring system. Various methods will meet the
requirements of the regulation. One method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the
average score for each of those factors achieved by applicants whose total score was at or slightly above the minimum
passing score. Another method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average
score for each of those factors achieved by all applicants. These average scores could be calculated during the
development or use of the system. Any other method that produces results substantially similar to either of these methods
is also acceptable under the regulation.
6. Judgmental system. If a creditor uses a judgmental system, the reasons for the denial or other adverse action must relate to
those factors in the applicant's record actually reviewed by the person making the decision.
7. Combined credit scoring and judgmental system. If a creditor denies an application based on a credit evaluation system that
employs both credit scoring and judgmental components, the reasons for the denial must come from the component of the
system that the applicant failed. For example, if a creditor initially credit scores an application and denies the credit request
as a result of that scoring, the reasons disclosed to the applicant must relate to the factors scored in the system.

These average scores could be calculated during the
development or use of the system. Any other method that produces results substantially similar to either of these methods
is also acceptable under the regulation.
6. Judgmental system. If a creditor uses a judgmental system, the reasons for the denial or other adverse action must relate to

Step 3. Compare Approved and Denied Applications
Overview: Although a creditor’s written policies and
procedures may appear to be nondiscriminatory, lending
personnel may interpret or apply policies in a
discriminatory manner. In order to detect any disparate
treatment among applicants, the examiner should first
eliminate all but “marginal transactions” (see 3.b. below)
from each selected focal point sample. Then, a detailed
profile of each marginal applicant’s qualifications, the
level of assistance received during the application process,
the reasons for denial, the loan terms, and other
information should be recorded on an Applicant Profile
Spreadsheet. Once profiled, the examiner can compare the
target and control groups for evidence that similarly
qualified applicants have been treated differently as to
either the institution’s credit decision or the quality of
assistance provided.
a. Create Applicant Profile Spreadsheet
Based upon the institution’s written and/or articulated
credit standards and loan policies, identify categories of
data that should be recorded for each applicant and
provide a field for each of these categories on a
worksheet or computerized spreadsheet. Certain data
(income, loan amount, debt, etc.) should always be
included in the spreadsheet, while the other data
selected will be tailored for each loan product and
institution based on applicable underwriting criteria
and such issues as branch location and underwriter.
Where credit bureau scores and/or application scores
are an element of the institution’s underwriting criteria
(or where such information is regularly recorded in
loan files, whether expressly used or not), include a
data field for this information in the spread sheet.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the quality of
assistance provided to target and control group applicants,
respectively, every work sheet should provide a
“comments” block appropriately labeled as the site for
recording observations from the file or interviews
regarding how an applicant was, or was not, assisted in
overcoming credit deficiencies or otherwise qualifying for
approval.
b. Complete Applicant Profiles
From the application files sample for each focal point,
complete applicant profiles for selected denied and
approved applications as follows:
• A principal goal is to identify cases where similarly
qualified prohibited basis and control group
applicants had different credit outcomes, because the
agencies have found that discrimination, including
differences in granting assistance during the approval
process, is more likely to occur with respect to
applicants who are not either clearly qualified or
unqualified ( i.e., “marginal” applicants). The
examiner-in-charge should, during the following
steps, judgmentally select from the initial sample
only those denied and approved applications which
constitute marginal transactions. (See Appendix on
Identifying Marginal Transactions for guidance)
• If few marginal control group applicants are identified
from the initial sample, review additional files of
approved control group applicants. This will either
increase the number of marginal approvals or confirm that
marginal approvals are so infrequent that the marginal
denials are unlikely to involve disparate treatment.
• The judgmental selection of both marginal-denied and
marginal-approved applicant loan files should be done
together, in a “back and forth” manner, to facilitate
close matches and a more consistent definition of
“marginal” between these two types of loan files.
• Once the marginal files have been identified, the data
elements called for on the profile spreadsheet are
extracted or noted and entered.
• While conducting the preceding step, the examiner
should simultaneously look for and document on the
spreadsheet any evidence found in marginal files
regarding the following:
° the extent of any assistance, including both
affirmative aid and waivers or partial waivers of
credit policy provisions or requirements, that
appears to have been provided to marginalapproved control group applicants which enabled
them to overcome one or more credit deficiencies,
such as excessive debt-to-income ratios; and
° the extent to which marginal-denied target group
applicants with similar deficiencies were, or were
not, provided similar affirmative aid, waivers or
other forms of assistance.
c. Review and Compare Profiles
• For each focal point, review all marginal profiles to determine
if the underwriter followed institution lending policies in
denying applications and whether the reason(s) for denial were
supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly
disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If any (a)
unexplained deviations from credit standards, (b) inaccurate
reasons for denial or (c) incorrect disclosures are noted,
(whether in a judgmental underwriting system, a scored
system or a mixed system) the examiner should obtain an
explanation from the underwriter and document the response
on an appropriate workpaper.
NOTE: In constructing the applicant profiles to be
compared, examiners must adjust the facts compared so that
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.15
assistance, waivers, or acts of discretion are treated
consistently between applicants. For example, if a control
group applicant’s DTI ratio was lowered to 42% because
the institution decided to include short-term overtime
income and a prohibited basis group applicant who was
denied due to “insufficient income” would have had his
ratio drop from 46% to 41% if his short-term overtime
income had been considered, then the examiners should
consider 41%, not 46%, in determining the benchmark.
• For each reason for denial identified within the target
group, rank the denied prohibited basis applicants,
beginning with the applicant whose qualification(s)
related to that reason for denial were least deficient.
(The top-ranked denied applicant in each such ranking
will be referred to below as the “benchmark”
applicant.)
• Compare each marginal control group approval to the
benchmark applicant in each reason-for-denial ranking
developed in step (b), above. If there are no approvals
who are equally or less qualified, then there are no
instances of disparate treatment for the institution to
account for. For all such approvals that appear no better
qualified than the denied benchmark applicant
o identify the approved loan on the worksheet or
spreadsheet as an “overlap approval,” and
o compare that overlap approval with other
marginal prohibited basis denials in the ranking to
determine whether additional overlaps exist. If
so, identify all overlapping approvals and denials
as above.
• Where the focal point involves use of a credit scoring
system, the analysis for disparate treatment is similar to
the procedures set forth in (c) above, and should focus
primarily on overrides of the scoring system itself. For
guidance on this type of analysis, refer to Considering
Automated Underwriting and Credit Scoring, Part C in
the Appendix.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.

to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.
G. Analysis of Potential Discriminatory “Redlining”
Overview: For purposes of this analysis, traditional “redlining”
is a form of illegal disparate treatment in which an institution
provides unequal access to credit, or unequal terms of credit,
because of the race, color, national origin, or other prohibited
characteristic(s) of the residents of the area in which the credit
seeker resides or will reside or in which the residential
property to be mortgaged is located. Redlining may also
include “reverse redlining,” the practice of targeting certain
borrowers or areas with less advantageous products or services
based on prohibited characteristics.
The redlining analysis may be applied to determine whether,
on a prohibited basis:
• an institution fails or refuses to extend credit in certain
areas;
• an institution targets certain borrowers or certain areas
with less advantageous products:
• an institution makes loans in such an area but at a
restricted level or upon less-favorable terms or conditions
as compared to contrasting areas; or
• an institution omits or excludes such an area from efforts
to market residential loans or solicit customers for
residential credit.
This guidance focuses on possible discrimination based on
race or national origin. The same analysis could be adapted
to evaluate relative access to credit for areas of geographical
concentration on other prohibited bases — for example,
age.
NOTE: It is true that neither the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) nor the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) specifically uses
the term “redlining.” However, federal courts as well as
agencies that have enforcement responsibilities for the FHAct,
have interpreted it as prohibiting institutions from having
different marketing or lending practices for certain
geographic areas, compared to others, where the purpose or
effect of such differences would be to discriminate on a
prohibited basis. Similarly, the ECOA would prohibit treating
applicants for credit differently on the basis of differences in
the racial or ethnic composition of their respective
neighborhoods.
Like other forms of disparate treatment, redlining can be
proven by overt or comparative evidence. If any written or
oral policy or statement of the institution (see risk factors R6-
10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
",How should a creditor disclose the reasons for denying a credit request when using a combined credit scoring and judgmental system?,"The reasons for denying a credit request when using a combined credit scoring and judgmental system should be supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If there are any unexplained deviations from credit standards, inaccurate reasons for denial, or incorrect disclosures, the examiner should obtain an explanation from the underwriter and document the response on an appropriate workpaper.","Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.14 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
Step 3. Compare Approved and Denied Applications
Overview: Although a creditor’s written policies and
procedures may appear to be nondiscriminatory, lending
personnel may interpret or apply policies in a
discriminatory manner. In order to detect any disparate
treatment among applicants, the examiner should first
eliminate all but “marginal transactions” (see 3.b. below)
from each selected focal point sample. Then, a detailed
profile of each marginal applicant’s qualifications, the
level of assistance received during the application process,
the reasons for denial, the loan terms, and other
information should be recorded on an Applicant Profile
Spreadsheet. Once profiled, the examiner can compare the
target and control groups for evidence that similarly
qualified applicants have been treated differently as to
either the institution’s credit decision or the quality of
assistance provided.
a. Create Applicant Profile Spreadsheet
Based upon the institution’s written and/or articulated
credit standards and loan policies, identify categories of
data that should be recorded for each applicant and
provide a field for each of these categories on a
worksheet or computerized spreadsheet. Certain data
(income, loan amount, debt, etc.) should always be
included in the spreadsheet, while the other data
selected will be tailored for each loan product and
institution based on applicable underwriting criteria
and such issues as branch location and underwriter.
Where credit bureau scores and/or application scores
are an element of the institution’s underwriting criteria
(or where such information is regularly recorded in
loan files, whether expressly used or not), include a
data field for this information in the spread sheet.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the quality of
assistance provided to target and control group applicants,
respectively, every work sheet should provide a
“comments” block appropriately labeled as the site for
recording observations from the file or interviews
regarding how an applicant was, or was not, assisted in
overcoming credit deficiencies or otherwise qualifying for
approval.
b. Complete Applicant Profiles
From the application files sample for each focal point,
complete applicant profiles for selected denied and
approved applications as follows:
• A principal goal is to identify cases where similarly
qualified prohibited basis and control group
applicants had different credit outcomes, because the
agencies have found that discrimination, including
differences in granting assistance during the approval
process, is more likely to occur with respect to
applicants who are not either clearly qualified or
unqualified ( i.e., “marginal” applicants). The
examiner-in-charge should, during the following
steps, judgmentally select from the initial sample
only those denied and approved applications which
constitute marginal transactions. (See Appendix on
Identifying Marginal Transactions for guidance)
• If few marginal control group applicants are identified
from the initial sample, review additional files of
approved control group applicants. This will either
increase the number of marginal approvals or confirm that
marginal approvals are so infrequent that the marginal
denials are unlikely to involve disparate treatment.
• The judgmental selection of both marginal-denied and
marginal-approved applicant loan files should be done
together, in a “back and forth” manner, to facilitate
close matches and a more consistent definition of
“marginal” between these two types of loan files.
• Once the marginal files have been identified, the data
elements called for on the profile spreadsheet are
extracted or noted and entered.
• While conducting the preceding step, the examiner
should simultaneously look for and document on the
spreadsheet any evidence found in marginal files
regarding the following:
° the extent of any assistance, including both
affirmative aid and waivers or partial waivers of
credit policy provisions or requirements, that
appears to have been provided to marginalapproved control group applicants which enabled
them to overcome one or more credit deficiencies,
such as excessive debt-to-income ratios; and
° the extent to which marginal-denied target group
applicants with similar deficiencies were, or were
not, provided similar affirmative aid, waivers or
other forms of assistance.
c. Review and Compare Profiles
• For each focal point, review all marginal profiles to determine
if the underwriter followed institution lending policies in
denying applications and whether the reason(s) for denial were
supported by facts documented in the loan file and properly
disclosed to the applicant pursuant to Regulation B. If any (a)
unexplained deviations from credit standards, (b) inaccurate
reasons for denial or (c) incorrect disclosures are noted,
(whether in a judgmental underwriting system, a scored
system or a mixed system) the examiner should obtain an
explanation from the underwriter and document the response
on an appropriate workpaper.
NOTE: In constructing the applicant profiles to be
compared, examiners must adjust the facts compared so that
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.15
assistance, waivers, or acts of discretion are treated
consistently between applicants. For example, if a control
group applicant’s DTI ratio was lowered to 42% because
the institution decided to include short-term overtime
income and a prohibited basis group applicant who was
denied due to “insufficient income” would have had his
ratio drop from 46% to 41% if his short-term overtime
income had been considered, then the examiners should
consider 41%, not 46%, in determining the benchmark.
• For each reason for denial identified within the target
group, rank the denied prohibited basis applicants,
beginning with the applicant whose qualification(s)
related to that reason for denial were least deficient.
(The top-ranked denied applicant in each such ranking
will be referred to below as the “benchmark”
applicant.)
• Compare each marginal control group approval to the
benchmark applicant in each reason-for-denial ranking
developed in step (b), above. If there are no approvals
who are equally or less qualified, then there are no
instances of disparate treatment for the institution to
account for. For all such approvals that appear no better
qualified than the denied benchmark applicant
o identify the approved loan on the worksheet or
spreadsheet as an “overlap approval,” and
o compare that overlap approval with other
marginal prohibited basis denials in the ranking to
determine whether additional overlaps exist. If
so, identify all overlapping approvals and denials
as above.
• Where the focal point involves use of a credit scoring
system, the analysis for disparate treatment is similar to
the procedures set forth in (c) above, and should focus
primarily on overrides of the scoring system itself. For
guidance on this type of analysis, refer to Considering
Automated Underwriting and Credit Scoring, Part C in
the Appendix.
","Step 2. Conduct Comparative File Review
a. Select all (or a maximum of ten) denied applications that
were acted on during the three month period prior to the
examination. To the extent feasible, include denied
applications from businesses that are (i) located in
minority and/or integrated geographies or (ii) appear to be
owned by women or minority group members, based on
the names of the principals shown on applications or
related documents. (In the case of institutions that do a
significant volume of commercial lending, consider
reviewing more than ten applications.)
b. For each of the denied commercial applications selected,
record specific information from loan files and through
interviews with the appropriate loan officer(s), about the
principal owners, the purpose of the loan, and the specific,
pertinent financial information about the commercial
enterprise (including type of business — retail,
manufacturing, service, etc.), that was used by the
institution to evaluate the credit request. Maintenance or
use of data that identifies prohibited basis characteristics
of those involved with the business (either in approved or
denied loan applications) should be evaluated as a
potential violation of Regulation B.
c. Select ten approved loans that appear to be similar with
regard to business type, purpose of loan, loan amount,
loan terms, and type of collateral, as the denied loans
sampled. For example, if the denied loan sample
includes applications for lines of credit to cover
inventory purchases for retail businesses, the examiner
should select approved applications for lines of credit
from retail businesses.
d. For each approved commercial loan application
selected, obtain and record information parallel to that
obtained for denied applications.
e. The examiner should first compare the credit criteria
considered in the credit process for each of the
approved and denied applications to established
underwriting standards, rather than comparing files
directly.
f. The examiner should identify any deviations from
credit standards for both approved and denied credit
requests, and differences in loan terms granted for
approved credit requests.
g. The examiner should discuss each instance where
deviations from credit standards and terms were noted,
but were not explained in the file, with the commercial
credit underwriter. Each discussion should be
documented.
Step 3. Conduct Targeted Sampling
a. If deviations from credit standards or pricing are not
sufficiently explained by other factors either
documented in the credit file or the commercial
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.19
underwriter was not able to provide a reasonable
explanation, the examiner should determine if
deviations were detrimental to any protected classes of
applicants.
b. The examiner should consider employing the same
techniques for determining race and gender
characteristics of commercial applicants as those
outlined in the consumer loan sampling procedures.
c. If it is determined that there are members of one or more
prohibited basis groups among commercial credit
requests that were not underwritten according to
established standards or received less favorable terms,
the examiner should select additional commercial loans,
where applicants are members of the same prohibited
basis group and select similarly situated control group
credit requests in order to determine whether there is a
pattern or practice of discrimination. These additional
files should be selected based on the specific applicant
circumstance(s) that appeared to have been viewed
differently by lending personnel on a prohibited basis.
d. If there are not enough similarly situated applicants for
comparison in the original sample period to draw a
reasonable conclusion, the examiner should expand the
sample period. The expanded sample period should
generally not go beyond the date of the prior examination.
Sampling Guidelines
a. Generally, the task of selecting an appropriate expanded
sample of prohibited basis and control group applications
for commercial loans will require examiner judgment.
The examiner should select a sample that is large enough
to be able to draw a reasonable conclusion.
b. The examiner should first select from the applications that
were acted on during the initial sample period, but were
not included in the initial sample, and select applications
from prior time periods as necessary.
c. The expanded sample should include both approved and
denied, prohibited basis and control group applications,
where similar credit was requested by similar enterprises
for similar purposes.

10 in Part I, above) suggests that the institution links the racial
or national origin character of an area with any aspect of
access to or terms of credit, the examiners should refer to the
guidance in Section B of this Part III, on documenting and
evaluating overt evidence of discrimination.
Overt evidence includes not only explicit statements, but
also any geographical terms used by the institution that
would, to a reasonable person familiar with the community
in question, connote a specific racial or national origin
character. For example, if the principal information
conveyed by the phrase “north of 110th Street” is that the
indicated area is principally occupied by Hispanics, then a
policy of not making credit available “north of 110th Street”
is overt evidence of potential redlining on the basis of
national origin.
Overt evidence is relatively uncommon. Consequently, the
redlining analysis usually will focus on comparative
evidence (similar to analyses of possible disparate treatment
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
IV – 1.20 FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021
of individual customers) in which the institution’s treatment
of areas with contrasting racial or national origin characters
is compared.
When the scoping process (including consultation within
an agency as called for by agency procedures) indicates
that a redlining analysis should be initiated, examiners
should complete the following steps of comparative
analysis:
1. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that have a racial or
national origin character;
2. Determine whether any minority area identified in Step 1
appears to be excluded, under-served, selectively
excluded from marketing efforts, or otherwise lessfavorably treated in any way by the institution;
3. Identify and delineate any areas within the institution’s
CRA assessment area and reasonably expected market
area for residential products that are non-minority in
character and that the institution appears to treat more
favorably;
4. Identify the location of any minority areas located just
outside the institution’s CRA assessment area and market
area for residential products, such that the institution may
be purposely avoiding such areas;
5. Obtain the institution’s explanation for the apparent
difference in treatment between the areas and evaluate
whether it is credible and reasonable; and
6. Obtain and evaluate other information that may support or
contradict interpreting identified disparities to be the result
of intentional illegal discrimination.
These steps are discussed in detail below.
",incorrect,"The answer provided does not directly address how a creditor should disclose the reasons for denying a credit request when using a combined credit scoring and judgmental system as outlined in the reference text. The reference text specifies that the reasons for denial in such a system must come from the component of the system that the applicant failed, and the disclosed reasons must relate to the factors scored in the system. The answer talks about obtaining explanations for deviations from credit standards and inaccurate reasons, which is not the specific requirement for disclosing denial reasons in a combined credit scoring and judgmental system.",

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.

discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.
Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.

Evaluating the Potential for Discriminatory Conduct
Step One: Develop an Overview
Based on his or her understanding of the credit operations and
product offerings of an institution, an examiner should
determine the nature and amount of information required for 
IV. Fair Lending — Fair Lending Laws and Regulations
FDIC Consumer Compliance Examination Manual – March 2021 IV – 1.7
the scoping process and should obtain and organize that
information. No single examination can reasonably be
expected to evaluate compliance performance as to every
prohibited basis, in every product, or in every underwriting
center or subsidiary of an institution. In addition to
information gained in the process of Understanding Credit
Operations, above, the examiner should keep in mind the
following factors when selecting products for the scoping
review:
• Which products and prohibited bases were reviewed
during the most recent prior examination(s) and,
conversely, which products and prohibited bases have not
recently been reviewed?
• Which prohibited basis groups make up a significant
portion of the institution’s market for the different credit
products offered?
• Which products and prohibited basis groups the institution
reviewed using either a voluntarily disclosed self-test or a
self-evaluation?
Based on consideration of the foregoing factors, the examiner
should request information for all residential and other loan
products considered appropriate for scoping in the current
examination cycle. In addition, wherever feasible, examiners
should conduct preliminary interviews with the institution’s
key underwriting personnel and those involved with
establishing the institution’s pricing policies and practices.
Using the accumulated information, the examiner should
evaluate the following, as applicable:
• Underwriting guidelines, policies, and standards.
• Descriptions of credit scoring systems, including a list of
factors scored, cutoff scores, extent of validation, and any
guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. (Refer
to Part A of the “Considering Automated Underwriting
and Credit Scoring” section of the Appendix for
guidance.)
• Applicable pricing policies, risk-based pricing models,
and guidance for exercising discretion over loan terms
and conditions.
• Descriptions of any compensation system, including
whether compensation is related to, loan production or
pricing.
• The institution’s formal and informal relationships with
any finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer
lending entities, or similar institutions.
",Explain how the credit scoring system works and what factors are considered in evaluating an application.,"The credit scoring system evaluates loan applications based on various factors such as age, underwriting guidelines, credit scoring systems, pricing policies, risk-based pricing models, and compensation systems. Factors considered include the list of scored factors, cutoff scores, validation extent, and guidance for handling overrides and exceptions. The system also takes into account the institution's relationships with finance companies, subprime mortgage or consumer lending entities, or similar institutions.","I. Credit Scoring.
If the scoping process results in the selection of a focal point
that includes a credit or mortgage scored loan product, refer
to the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
If the institution utilizes a credit scoring program which
scores age for any loan product selected for review in the
scoping stage, either as the sole underwriting determinant or
only as a guide to making loan decisions, refer to Part E of
the Considering Automated Underwriting and Credit
Scoring section of the Appendix.
J. Disparate Impact Issues.
","This will help
examiners to recognize the potential scope of policybased violations.
• The portfolio consists of applications from a purchased
institution. If so, for scoping purposes, examiners
should consider the applications as if they were made to
the purchasing institution. For comparison purposes,
applications evaluated under the purchased institution’s
standards should not be compared to applications
evaluated under the purchasing institution’s standards.
• The portfolio includes purchased loans. If so, examiners
should look for indications that the institution specified
loans to purchase based on a prohibited factor or caused a
prohibited factor to influence the origination process.
• A complete decision can be made at one of the several
underwriting or loan processing centers, each with
independent authority. In such a situation, it is best to
conduct on-site a separate comparative analysis at each
underwriting center. If covering multiple centers is not
feasible during the planned examination, examiners should
review their processes and internal controls to determine
whether or not expanding the scope and/or length of the
examination is justified.
• Decision-making responsibility for a single transaction
may involve more than one underwriting center. For
example, an institution may have authority to decline
mortgage applicants, but only the mortgage company
subsidiary may approve them. In such a situation,
examiners should learn which standards are applied in
each entity and the location of records needed for the
planned comparisons.
• Applicants can be steered from the financial institution to
the subsidiary or other lending channel and vice versa, and
what policies and procedures exist to monitor this practice.
• Any third parties, such as brokers or contractors, are
involved in the credit decision and how responsibility is
allocated among them and the institution. The
institution’s familiarity with third party actions may be
important, for an institution may be in violation if it
participates in transactions in which it knew or reasonably
ought to have known other parties were discriminating.
As part of understanding the financial institution’s own
lending operations, it is also important to understand any
dealings the financial institution has with affiliated and nonaffiliated mortgage loan brokers and other third party
lenders.
These brokers may generate mortgage applications and
originations solely for a specific financial institution or may
broadly gather loan applicationsfor a variety of local,
regional, or national lenders. As a result, it is important to
recognize what impact these mortgage brokers and other
third party lender actions and application processing
operations have on the lending operations of a financial
institution. Because brokers can be located anywhere in or
out of the financial institution’s primary lending or CRA
assessment areas, it is important to evaluate broker activity
and fair lending compliance related to underwriting, terms,
and conditions, redlining, and steering, each of which is
covered in more depth in sections of these procedures.
Examiners should consult with their respective agencies for
specific guidance regarding broker activity.
If the institution is large and geographically diverse,
examiners should select only as many markets or
underwriting centers as can be reviewed readily in depth,
rather than selecting proportionally to cover every market.
As needed, examiners should narrow the focus to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or underwriting
center(s) that are determined to present the highest
discrimination risk. Examiners should use Loan Application
Register (LAR) data organized by underwriting center, if
available. After calculating denial rates between the control
and prohibited basis groups for the underwriting centers,
examiners should select the centers with the highest fair
lending risk. This approach would also be used when
reviewing pricing or other terms and conditions of approved
applicants from the prohibited basis and control groups. If
underwriting centers have fewer than five racial or national
origin denials, examiners should not examine for racial
discrimination in underwriting. Instead, they should shift the
focus to other loan products or prohibited bases, or
examination types such as a pricing examination.
However, if examiners learn of other indications of risks that
favor analyzing a prohibited basis with fewer transactions
than the minimum in the sample size tables, they should
consult with their supervisory office on possible alternative
methods of analysis. For example, there is strong reason to
examine a pattern in which almost all of 19 male borrowers
received low rates but almost all of four female borrowers
received high rates, even though the number of each group is
fewer than the stated minimum. Similarly, there would be
strong reason to examine a pattern in which almost all of 100
control group applicants were approved but all four
prohibited basis group applicants were not, even though the
number of prohibited basis denials was fewer than five.

This failure to maintain the threshold in subsequent years means it no longer satisfies the definition of a covered financial institution at the time of the compliance date for Tier 3 institutions.","The financial institution must compile data for this period pursuant to § 1002.107, comply with
the firewall requirements of § 1002.108, and maintain records as specified in § 1002.111. In addition, for data
collected during this period, the covered financial institution must comply with §§ 1002.109 and 1002.110(c) and (d)
by June 1, 2026.
3. Informal names for compliance date provisions. To facilitate discussion of the compliance dates specified in § 1002.114(b)
(1), (2), and (3), in the official commentary and any other documents referring to these compliance dates, the Bureau adopts
the following informal simplified names. Tier 1 refers to the cohort of covered financial institutions that have a compliance
date of October 1, 2024 pursuant to § 1002.114(b)(1). Tier 2 refers to the cohort of covered financial institutions that have a
compliance date of April 1, 2025 pursuant to § 1002.114(b)(2). Tier 3 refers to the cohort of covered financial institutions
that have a compliance date of January 1, 2026 pursuant to § 1002.114(b)(3).
4. Examples. The following scenarios illustrate how to determine whether a financial institution is a covered financial
institution and which compliance date specified in § 1002.114(b) applies.
i. Financial Institution A originated 3,000 covered credit transactions for small businesses in calendar year 2022, and
3,000 in calendar year 2023. Financial Institution A is in Tier 1 and has a compliance date of October 1, 2024.
ii. Financial Institution B originated 2,000 covered credit transactions for small businesses in calendar year 2022, and
3,000 in calendar year 2023. Because Financial Institution B did not originate at least 2,500 covered credit transactions
for small businesses in each of 2022 and 2023, it is not in Tier 1. Because Financial Institution B did originate at least
500 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of 2022 and 2023, it is in Tier 2 and has a compliance
date of April 1, 2025.
iii.

Because Financial Institution E
originated at least 100 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of 2022 and 2023, it is in Tier 3 and
has a compliance date of January 1, 2026. However, because Financial Institution E did not originate at least 100
covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of 2024 and 2025, it no longer satisfies the definition of a
covered financial institution in § 1002.105(b) at the time of the compliance date for Tier 3 institutions and thus is not
required to comply with the rule in 2026.
vi. Financial Institution F originated 90 covered credit transactions for small businesses in calendar year 2022, and 120 in
2023, 2024, and 2025. Because Financial Institution F did not originate at least 100 covered credit transactions for
small businesses in each of 2022 and 2023, it is not in Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3. Because Financial Institution F
originated at least 100 covered credit transactions for small businesses in subsequent calendar years, § 1002.114(b)
(4), which cross-references § 1002.105(b), applies to Financial Institution F. Because Financial Institution F originated
at least 100 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of 2024 and 2025, it is a covered financial
institution under § 1002.105(b) and is required to comply with the rule beginning January 1, 2026.

2023, 2024, and 2025, and 120 in each of 2026 and 2027. Because Financial Institution F did not originate at least 100

This involvement includes activities such as serving as underwriters and making decisions specifically related to a particular application or applicant.,"An employee or officer is not involved in making a
determination concerning a covered application if the employee or officer is only involved in making a decision that
affects covered applications generally, or if the employee or officer only interacts with small businesses prior to them
becoming applicants or submitting an application. An employee or officer may be participating in a determination
concerning a covered application even if the employee or officer is not the ultimate decision maker or the sole decision
maker. For example, an employee participates in a determination concerning a covered application if the employee
recommends that another employee or officer approve or deny the application. Similarly, an employee or officer
participates in a determination concerning a covered application if the employee or officer is part of a larger group,
such as a committee, that makes a determination concerning a covered application. For example, an employee
participates in a decision if the employee is a member of a committee that approves the terms offered to an applicant
for a covered application. This is true even if the employee does not support the committee's ultimate decision
regarding the terms offered. Conversely, an employee or officer does not participate in a determination concerning a
covered application if the employee or officer only performs ministerial functions for the committee, such as recording
the minutes, or if the committee does not make a determination concerning a specific covered application.
ii. Examples of activities that do not constitute being involved in making a determination concerning a covered application
from a small business. The following are examples of activities that do not constitute being involved in making a
determination concerning a covered application:
A. Developing policies and procedures, designing or programming computer or other systems, or conducting
marketing.
B. Discussing credit products, loan terms, or loan requirements with a small business before it submits a covered
application.
C. Making or participating in a decision after the financial institution has taken final action on the covered
application, such as a decision about servicing or collecting a covered credit transaction.
D. Using a check box form to confirm whether an applicant has submitted all necessary documents or handling a
minor or clerical matter during the application process, such as suggesting or selecting a time for an
appointment with an applicant.

However, if the
applicant failed to respond (such as by leaving the response to the question blank or by failing to return a data collection
form), the financial institution must inquire about the applicant's minority-owned business status, women-owned business
status, LGBTQI+-owned business status, and principal owners' ethnicity, race, or sex, as applicable, in connection with a
subsequent application because the data were not previously obtained. See also comment 107(a)(19)-11 concerning

i. General. An employee or officer is involved in making a determination concerning a covered application from a small
business for purposes of § 1002.108 if the employee or officer makes, or otherwise participates in, a decision
regarding the evaluation of a covered application from a small business or the creditworthiness of a small business
applicant for a covered credit transaction. This includes, but is not limited to, employees and officers serving as
underwriters. The decision that an employee or officer makes or participates in must be about a specific covered
application or about the creditworthiness of a specific applicant. An employee or officer is not involved in making a
determination concerning a covered application if the employee or officer is only involved in making a decision that
affects covered applications generally, or if the employee or officer only interacts with small businesses prior to them

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

reasons for it and the persons authorizing or directing the
use of the statement or practice.

the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.
","c. How and when the policy or communication was put
into effect.
d. How widely the policy or communication was applied.
e. Whether and to what extent applicants were adversely
affected by the policy or communication.
Step 2. Where any indicator of overt discrimination was an
oral statement or unwritten practice, determine and
document:
a. The precise nature of both the statement, or practice, and
of the fair lending concerns that they raise.
b. The identity of the persons making the statement or
applying the practice and their descriptions of the
reasons for it and the persons authorizing or directing the
use of the statement or practice.

Examples. Section 1002.105(a) defines a financial institution as any partnership, company, corporation,
association (incorporated or unincorporated), trust, estate, cooperative organization, or other entity
that engages in any financial activity. This definition includes, but is not limited to, banks, savings
associations, credit unions, online lenders, platform lenders, community development financial
institutions, Farm Credit System lenders, lenders involved in equipment and vehicle financing (captive
financing companies and independent financing companies), commercial finance companies,
organizations exempt from taxation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 501(c), and governments or governmental
subdivisions or agencies.
2. Motor vehicle dealers. Pursuant to § 1002.101(a), subpart B of this part excludes from coverage

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 2004
(2010).
1. Preceding calendar year. The definition of covered financial institution refers to preceding calendar
years. For example, in 2029, the two preceding calendar years are 2027 and 2028. Accordingly, in 2029,
Financial Institution A does not meet the loan-volume threshold in § 1002.105(b) if did not originate at
least 100 covered credit transactions for small businesses both during 2027 and during 2028.

2. Origination threshold. A financial institution qualifies as a covered financial institution based on total
covered credit transactions originated for small businesses, rather than covered applications received
from small businesses. For example, if in both 2024 and 2025, Financial Institution B received 105
covered applications from small businesses and originated 95 covered credit transactions for small
businesses, then for 2026, Financial Institution B is not a covered financial institution.

Step Five: Organize and Focus Residential Risk Analysis
Review the risk factors identified in Step 4 and, for each loan
product that displays risk factors, articulate the possible
discriminatory effects encountered and organize the
examination of those loan products in accordance with the
following guidance. For complex issues regarding these
factors, consult with agency supervisory staff.
• Where overt evidence of discrimination, as described in
factors O1-O5, has been found in connection with a
product, document those findings as described in Part III,
B, besides completing the remainder of the planned
examination analysis.
• Where any of the risk factors U1-U9 are present,
consider conducting an underwriting comparative file
analysis as described in Part III, C.
• Where any of the risk factors P1-P7 are present,
consider conducting a pricing comparative file analysis
as described in Part III, D.
• Where any of the risk factors S1-S8 are present,
consider conducting a steering analysis as described in
Part III, E.
• Where any of the risk factors R1-R12 are present,
consider conducting an analysis for redlining as described
in Part III, G.
• Where any of the risk factors M1-M7 are present,
consider conducting a marketing analysis as described in
Part III, H.
• Where an institution uses age in any credit scoring system,
consider conducting an examination analysis of that credit
scoring system’s compliance with the requirements of
Regulation B as described in Part III, I.
Step Six: Identify Consumer Lending Discrimination Risk
Factors
For any consumer loan products selected in Step One for risk
analysis, examiners should conduct a risk factor review similar
to that conducted for residential lending products in Steps
Three through Five, above. Examiners should consult with
agency supervisory staff regarding the potential use of
surrogates to identify possible prohibited basis group
individuals.
",How does subpart B of this part exclude motor vehicle dealers from coverage?,Subpart B of this part excludes motor vehicle dealers from coverage by specifying that the requirements of the subpart do not apply to any motor vehicle dealer.,"U3. *Substantially higher proportion of withdrawn/
incomplete applications from prohibited basis group
applicants than from other applicants.
U4. Vague or unduly subjective underwriting criteria.
U5. Lack of clear guidance on making exceptions to
underwriting criteria, including credit scoring overrides.
U6. Lack of clear loan file documentation regarding reasons
for any exceptions to standard underwriting criteria,
including credit scoring overrides.
U7. Relatively high percentages of either exceptions to
underwriting criteria or overrides of credit score cutoffs.
U8. Loan officer or broker compensation based on loan
volume (especially loans approved per period of time).
U9. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in loan
processing or in approving/denying residential loans.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment in Pricing (interest
rates, fees, or points) such as:
P1. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to
charge higher prices (including interest rate, fees and
points). Special attention should be given to situations
where financial incentives are accompanied by broad
pricing discretion (as in P2), such as through the use of
overages or yield spread premiums.
P2. Presence of broad discretion in loan pricing (including
interest rate, fees and points), such as through overages,
underages or yield spread premiums. Such discretion
may be present even when institutions provide rate sheets
and fees schedules, if loan officers or brokers are
permitted to deviate from those rates and fees without
clear and objective criteria.
P3. Use of risk-based pricing that is not based on objective
criteria or applied consistently.
P4. *Substantial disparities among prices being quoted or
charged to applicants who differ as to their monitored
prohibited basis characteristics.
P5. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing.
P6. *In mortgage pricing, disparities in the incidence or rate
spreads2 of higher-priced lending by prohibited basis
characteristics as reported in the HMDA data.
P7. *A loan program that contains only borrowers from a
 2 Regulation C, Section 203.4(a)(12)
prohibited basis group, or has significant differences in
the percentages of prohibited basis groups, especially in
the absence of a Special Purpose Credit Program under
ECOA.
Indicators of potential disparate treatment by Steering such
as:
S1. Lack of clear, objective and consistently implemented
standards for (i) referring applicants to subsidiaries,
affiliates, or lending channels within the institution (ii)
classifying applicants as “prime” or “sub-prime”
borrowers, or (iii) deciding what kinds of alternative
loan products should be offered or recommended to
applicants (product placement).
S2. Financial incentives for loan officers or brokers to place
applicants in nontraditional products (i.e., negative
amortization, “interest only”, “payment option”
adjustable rate mortgages) or higher cost products.
S3. For an institution that offers different products based on
credit risk levels, any significant differences in
percentages of prohibited basis groups in each of the
alternative loan product categories.
S4. *Significant differences in the percentage of prohibited
basis applicants in loan products or products with specific
features relative to control group applicants. Special
attention should be given to products and features that
have potentially negative consequences for applicants
(i.e., non-traditional mortgages, prepayment penalties,
lack of escrow requirements, or credit life insurance).
S5. *For an institution that has one or more sub-prime
mortgage subsidiaries or affiliates, any significant
differences, by loan product, in the percentage of
prohibited basis applicants of the institution compared to
the percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the
subsidiary(ies) or affiliate(s).
S6. *For an institution that has one or more lending channels
that originate the same loan product, any significant
differences in the percentage of prohibited basis
applicants in one of the lending channels compared to the
percentage of prohibited basis applicants of the other
lending channel.
S7. Consumer complaints alleging discrimination in
residential loan pricing or product placement.
S8. *For an institution with sub-prime mortgage subsidiaries,
a concentration of those subsidiaries’ branches in
minority areas relative to its other branches.

the number of applications received, withdrawn,
approved not accepted, and closed for incompleteness or
loans originated in those areas in the institution’s market
that have relatively high concentrations of minority group
residents compared with areas with relatively low
concentrations of minority residents.
R2. *Significant differences between approval/denial rates for
all applicants (minority and non-minority) in areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority group residents
compared with areas with relatively low concentrations of
minority residents.
R3. *Significant differences between denial rates based on
insufficient collateral for applicants from areas with
relatively high concentrations of minority residents and
those areas with relatively low concentrations of minority
residents.
R4. *Significant differences in the number of originations of
higher-priced loans or loans with potentially negative
consequences for borrowers, (i.e., non-traditional
mortgages, prepayment penalties, lack of escrow

low concentrations of minority residents.
R5. Other patterns of lending identified during the most
recent CRA examination that differ by the concentration

1. Charges during the initial annual period. The total initial annual charges include all charges scheduled to be imposed during
the initial annual period following origination. For example, if a financial institution originates a covered credit transaction
with a $50 monthly fee and a $100 annual fee, the financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by reporting
$700 in the initial annual charges reported. If there will be a charge in the initial annual period following origination but the
amount of that charge is uncertain at the time of origination, a financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by
not reporting that charge as scheduled to be imposed during the initial annual period following origination.
2. Interest excluded. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by excluding any interest expense from the
initial annual charges reported.
3. Avoidable charges. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by only including scheduled charges and
excluding any charges for events that are avoidable by the applicant from the initial annual charges reported. Examples of
avoidable charges include charges for late payment, for exceeding a credit limit, for delinquency or default, or for paying
items that overdraw an account.

4. Initial annual charges—examples. Examples of charges scheduled to be imposed during the initial annual period may include
monthly fees, annual fees, and other similar charges.
5. Scheduled charges with variable amounts. A financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by reporting as the
default the highest amount for a charge scheduled to be imposed. For example, if a covered credit transaction has a $75
monthly fee, but the fee is reduced to $0 if the applicant maintains an account at the financial institution originating the
covered credit transaction, the financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by reporting $900 ($75 × 12) in the
initial annual charges reported.
6. Transactions with a term of less than one year. For a transaction with a term of less than one year, a financial institution
complies with § 1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by reporting all charges scheduled to be imposed during the term of the transaction.
1. Merchant cash advances. Section 1002.107(a)(12)(v) requires a financial institution to report the difference between the
amount advanced and the amount to be repaid for a merchant cash advance or other sales-based financing transaction.

F. Transactional Underwriting Analysis — Commercial
Loans.
Overview: Unlike consumer credit, where loan products and
prices are generally homogenous and underwriting involves
the evaluation of a limited number of credit variables,
commercial loans are generally unique and underwriting
methods and loan pricing may vary depending on a large
number of credit variables. The additional credit analysis
that is involved in underwriting commercial credit products
will entail additional complexity in the sampling and
discrimination analysis process. Although ECOA prohibits
discrimination in all commercial credit activities of a covered
institution, the agencies recognize that small businesses (sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and small, closely-held
corporations) may have less experience in borrowing. Small
businesses may have fewer borrowing options, which may
make them more vulnerable to discrimination. Therefore, in
implementing these procedures, examinations should
generally be focused on small business credit (commercial
applicants that had gross revenues of $1,000,000 or less in
the preceding fiscal year), absent some evidence that a focus
on other commercial products would be more appropriate.
Step 1. Understand Commercial Loan Policies
For the commercial product line selected for analysis, the
examiner should first review credit policy guidelines and
interview appropriate commercial loan managers and officers
to obtain written and articulated standards used by the
institution in evaluating commercial loan applications.
NOTE: Examiners should consult their own agencies for
guidance on when a comparative analysis or statistical
analysis is appropriate, and follow their agencies procedures
for conducting such a review/analysis.

1. Other permissible collection of information. Information regarding ethnicity, race, and sex that is not required to
be collected pursuant to Regulation C, 12 CFR part 1003, or subpart B of this part, may nevertheless be collected
under the circumstances set forth in § 1002.5(a)(4) without violating § 1002.5(b). The information collected
pursuant to 12 CFR part 1003 must be retained pursuant to the requirements of § 1002.12. The information
collected pursuant to subpart B of this part must be retained pursuant to the requirements set forth in §
1002.111.
1. Indirect disclosure of prohibited information. The fact that certain credit-related information may indirectly disclose marital
status does not bar a creditor from seeking such information. For example, the creditor may ask about:
i. The applicant's obligation to pay alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income.
ii. The source of income to be used as the basis for repaying the credit requested, which could disclose that it is the
income of a spouse.
iii. Whether any obligation disclosed by the applicant has a co-obligor, which could disclose that the co-obligor is a
spouse or former spouse.
iv. The ownership of assets, which could disclose the interest of a spouse.
1. Disclosure about income. The sample application forms in appendix B to the regulation illustrate how a creditor
may inform an applicant of the right not to disclose alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income.
2. General inquiry about source of income. Since a general inquiry about the source of income may lead an applicant
to disclose alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income, a creditor making such an inquiry on an
application form should preface the request with the disclosure required by this paragraph.
3. Specific inquiry about sources of income. A creditor need not give the disclosure if the inquiry about income is
specific and worded in a way that is unlikely to lead the applicant to disclose the fact that income is derived from
alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. For example, an application form that asks about
specific types of income such as salary, wages, or investment income need not include the disclosure.",1,True,,"What are the appropriate notices that must be included in a creditor's form regarding the optional nature of courtesy titles, disclosure of alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, and limitation concerning marital status inquiries?","The appropriate notices that must be included in a creditor's form regarding the optional nature of courtesy titles, disclosure of alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, and limitation concerning marital status inquiries are as follows:
